Weekly total duration 125 minutes. Influenced by holiday life rhythm.\n*   **Training Cycle Peaks/Lows:**\n    *   **Peak Week:** Week 3, exercise habit most consolidated, body and mind adapted to brisk walking intensity, mental state score highest.\n    *   **Low Days:** Week 1 and end of Week 4 holiday, exercise not systematically conducted or intensity reduced, directly related to shift in life priorities.\n*   **Exercise Performance Changes:** Brisk walking performance improved with persistence. From \"initially felt somewhat strenuous\" on Jan 12 to \"completed 35 minutes against the wind... feeling refreshed\" on Jan 23, indicating improvement in cardiorespiratory endurance and psychological tolerance.\n\n#### **3.2 Health Trends**\n*   **Sleep Trend:** Sleep duration showed a \"V\"-shaped change. Slightly shortened in Week 2 (approx. 6.9 hours) due to initiating exercise and inventory work. Rebounded in Week 3 (approx. 7.3 hours) after habit formation. Longest in Week 4 holiday (approx. 7.8 hours) but with poor regularity.\n*   **Physiological Health Trends:** Weight and body fat percentage remained **extremely stable** in the first three weeks (fluctuation <0.5kg), related to regular exercise and dietary control. **Trend shift in Week 4**: weight increased 0.8kg over 4 days due to consecutive family gatherings, the most significant physiological indicator change this month. Resting heart rate and HRV trends were opposite; during regular exercise periods, resting heart rate decreased and HRV increased, indicating improved autonomic nervous system balance.\n*   **Mental Health Trends:** Stress values showed **event-driven fluctuations**. Reached first minor peak at end of Week 1 due to parental health event; climbed again mid-Week 3 due to work琐事; lowest during Spring Festival holiday. Emotional state closely followed family interaction quality; effective communication with parents and improved marital relationship brought positive emotional peaks.\n*   **Injury Impact:** Experienced **mild plantar fascia discomfort** after brisk walk on Jan 23, leading to adjustment of next day's exercise to light walking. Discomfort alleviated after 2 days rest (by Jan 25), did not significantly impact monthly exercise plan, but highlighted need to pay attention to exercise posture and recovery.\n\n#### **3.3 Life Rhythm Trends**\n*   **Sleep Schedule & Mental State:** Data shows that when your **bedtime was before 23:00**, next-day mental state was noticeably more refreshed, with 100% exercise plan execution rate; whereas when **bedtime was after 23:30**, next-day fatigue increased, leading to exercise plan cancellation or adjustment on 3 occasions.\n*   **Work/Life Rhythm Changes:** Weeks 1-3 followed a **work-oriented rhythm**, centered on inventory, planning, learning. Week 4 switched to a **family/social rhythm**, returning home for reunion. The impact of rhythm change on exercise was adjustment of location and time; impact on health was increased dietary intake and greater sleep schedule flexibility.\n\n### **Module 4: Personalized Insights**\n\n*   **Sleep ↔ Exercise Performance:** Your data indicates that **persisting with morning exercise has a positive guiding effect on sleep that night**. On days following a completed morning brisk walk, your rate of actively going to bed early (<23:00) was as high as 60%, compared to only 30% on non-exercise days. Data shows that one successful morning exercise session doubled your willingness to go to bed earlier that night.\n*   **Family Stress/Gatherings ↔ Health:** This month clearly demonstrated the **dual impact of emotional牵挂 and festive atmosphere on health management**. Worry about parents' health (Jan 5-6) led to emotional eating (weight +0.3kg) and delayed sleep. Conversely, the happiness of Spring Festival reunion brought relaxation, but also accompanied relaxation of dietary control (weight +0.8kg over 4 days). This suggests you need to develop specific psychological adjustment and dietary plans for \"emotional high-pressure periods\" and \"holiday scenarios\".\n*   **Exercise Type ↔ Physical State:** **Regular morning brisk walking was the foundational behavior for your health improvement this month**. Data shows that during periods of坚持 brisk walking (≥2 times/week), your self-reported frequency of \"feeling energetic all day\" significantly increased, and weekly average resting heart rate decreased by approx. 4 bpm. Furthermore, **yoga/stretching as a supplement** played a key role in rainy day alternatives and relieving shoulder/neck soreness, representing a good start for a multi-dimensional exercise habit.\n*   **Behavioral Habits ↔ Overall Health:** **The core impact of sleep schedule fluctuation lies in its \"chain reaction\" on the exercise plan**. Among the 11 late-sleep days this month, 5 directly led to cancellation or downgrading of next morning's exercise. Conversely, **prioritizing exercise in the morning** successfully ensured an 80% plan execution rate. Meanwhile, **shifting screen time towards learning** (fashion, baking courses) brought a sense of fulfillment, but prolonged evening study (>1.5 hours) was strongly correlated with late sleep, necessitating management of study duration.\n\n### **Module 5: Anomaly Event Summary**\n\n*   **Injury Event:**\n    *   **Occurrence Time & Type:** January 23rd, **mild left plantar fascia discomfort**.\n    *   **Impact Scope:** Caused planned brisk walk on Jan 24th to be changed to light walking, did not affect daily walking.\n    *   **Recovery Status:** After rest on Jan 24th and reduced-intensity brisk walk on Jan 25th, discomfort disappeared. Completed 30-minute park brisk walk on Jan 31st, **fully recovered**.\n*   **Exercise Gap Events:**\n    *   **Gap 1 (Planned Adjustment):** January 18th, 22nd, adjusted outdoor brisk walk to indoor stretching/aerobics due to rain, **not a true gap, considered flexible execution**.\n    *   **Gap 2 (Fatigue/Work):** January 14th, 20th, 27th, did not perform planned exercise due to previous day's fatigue or same-day work wrap-up busyness, **gap duration 1 day**.\n    *   **Recovery Performance:** Resumed exercise on the next planned day after each gap, with no sustained impact.\n*   **Health Indicator Fluctuation Event:**\n    *   **Fluctuating Indicator:** Weight.\n    *   **Fluctuation Time & Magnitude:** January 28th to 31st (Spring Festival holiday), **increased for 4 consecutive days, cumulative +0.8kg**.\n    *   **Fluctuation Cause:** Frequent family gatherings, daily caloric intake consistently exceeding daily expenditure, with slightly reduced exercise intensity.\n    *   **Subsequent Change:** Return",

Regular morning brisk walking started from 11th, combined with light activity on non-walking days, total duration approx. 120 minutes, stable exercise mode.\n    *   **Week 4 (17th-28th)**: Exercise volume rose then fell. Brisk walking continued 17th-19th, shifted to high-intensity walking again during business trip 20th-23rd, exercise interrupted due to ankle sprain on 25th, total duration not low but continuity disrupted.\n*   **Training Cycle Peaks/Lows**:\n    *   **Performance Peak**: Week 3 (10th-16th). Exercise plan fully executed this week, combined with positive mindset post-health check-up, highest exercise self-awareness, good brisk walking completion quality.\n    *   **Performance Low**: End of Week 4 (25th-28th). Affected by ankle sprain, active exercise forced to stop, entered recovery period.\n*   **Exercise Performance Changes**: Brisk walking performance showed an **adaptation and improvement trend**. From \"breathless, calves sore\" on the first attempt (11th) to \"steady pace\" on the 19th, indicating short-term improvement in cardio and muscular endurance. High-intensity walking during business trips served as effective cross-training but sudden increase in load also risked increased fatigue accumulation.\n\n**3.2 Health Trends**\n*   **Sleep Trends**:\n    *   Weekly Sleep Duration: Longest in Week 1 (holiday), shortest in Week 2 (store new stock, business trip), rebounded in Week 3 (relaxed after check-up), shortened again in Week 4 (business trip, planning). Data shows sleep decreased by an average of 0.5-1 hour during intensive work periods (Weeks 2, 4).\n    *   Sleep Fluctuation Reasons: Directly correlated with **work intensity** and **mental activity level**. For example, staying up late handling complaints on the 6th, planning sourcing on the 20th, and deep family discussions on the 27th all led to shortened sleep duration or reduced quality that night.\n*   **Physical Health Trends**:\n    *   Weekly weight trend strongly correlated with **dietary patterns** and **activity level**. The small weight peak in Week 2 corresponded to holiday gatherings and stress eating; weight steadily declined in Weeks 3 and 4, corresponding to healthy eating attempts and regular/high-intensity exercise.\n    *   HRV (inferred) and Resting Heart Rate (inferred) showed negative correlation with stressful events. For example, physiological stress indicators increased during high-pressure work periods in Weeks 2 and 4; improved during regular exercise and family support periods in Week 3.\n*   **Mental Health Trends**:\n    *   Stress values showed **event-driven fluctuations**. Stress values significantly decreased after completing specific tasks (e.g., check-up on 10th, sourcing return on 23rd) or receiving social support (e.g., confiding in close friend on 8th, couple's date on 15th, sister's support on 27th).\n    *   **Significant Link Between Exercise and Psychology**: Data shows that on days when morning brisk walking was executed (e.g., 11th, 12th, 17th, 19th), daily mood descriptions leaned more towards \"invigorated\", \"refreshed\", \"grounded\"; whereas on exercise break days or purely mental labor days, mood was more prone to \"anxious\", \"fatigued\".\n*   **Injury Impact**:\n    *   Occurrence Time: February 25th.\n    *   Impact: Directly caused the planned exercise (brisk walking) to halt, continuing until month-end. Forced exercise mode shift from aerobic brisk walking to static stretching, affecting exercise continuity for that week and the beginning of next month. No significant negative impact observed on weight or other indicators.\n\n**3.3 Life Rhythm Trends**\n*   **Sleep/Wake and Mental State**: Data shows a clear correlation. When bedtime was later than 23:30 (e.g., 6th, 20th), next-day state descriptions were mostly \"fatigued\", \"mentally excited but physically tired\", and exercise willingness or performance decreased that day (e.g., giving up attempt on 3rd). When bedtime was stable between 22:30-23:00 (e.g., 9th, 14th, 19th), next-day descriptions were mostly \"calm\", \"energetic\".\n*   **Work/Life Rhythm Changes**:\n    *   **Work Intensity Peaks**: Week 2 (4th-8th: business trip + store renovation), Week 4 (20th-23rd: second business trip + financial planning). These periods corresponded to the latest bedtimes, highest estimated stress values, and passive exercise shifts (high-intensity walking).\n    *   **Life Change**: The \"parental senior care issue\" at month-start became a background stressor throughout the month, but through multiple communications and planning mid-month (8th, 15th, 27th), transformed from emotional anxiety into a practical family project, converting psychological burden into action.\n\n**Personalized Insights**\n\n*   **Sleep ↔ Exercise Performance**: Data shows that when you obtained **over 7 hours of sleep and bedtime before 23:00** (e.g., 14th, 19th), the next day's morning brisk walking execution was smoother, with self-perception of \"energetic\". Conversely, on days following insufficient sleep or late nights (e.g., 3rd, after 20th), exercise initiation was difficult or felt unusually strenuous. Simultaneously, **single-day high-intensity mental activity (e.g., negotiations, financial calculations) or walking over 15,",

Weight loss during relocation directly correlated with high-intensity physical exertion and irregular diet.\n    *   **Resting Heart Rate & HRV**: Showed inverse correlation trends. Estimated RHR increased and HRV decreased during high-stress relocation; estimated RHR decreased and HRV recovered after joining choir and family gatherings late-month.\n*   **Mental Health Trends**:\n    *   **Stress & Mood**: Stress level curve highly synchronized with major life events. Positive family interactions (e.g., Mar 29 family meal), regular light activity (e.g., walks with father), and new mental engagements (e.g., joining choir) were effective stress buffers, noticeably improving mood state in Week 4.\n*   **Injury Impact**: No sports-related injuries reported this month. Minor cold on Mar 19 resolved quickly with timely rest (early sleep), causing no lasting impact on subsequent activity.\n\n**3.3 Life Rhythm Trends**\n*   **Routine & Mental State**: Data shows that whenever bedtime was past 23:30, next-day mental state and work focus declined, e.g., noticeable mood fluctuation on Mar 18 after staying up late. Conversely, after regular early sleep (e.g., Mar 19 due to cold) or high-quality rest days (e.g., Mar 29), next-day energy was充沛.\n*   **Work/Life Rhythm Changes**: This month's life rhythm was reshaped by three major events: **Procurement Business Trip** (brief switch to business rhythm), **Parents' Relocation** (full immersion in high-intensity family affairs), **New Family Dynamics Establishment** (forming a new daily routine connecting store, own home, and parents' home). Each rhythm change had a chain effect on activity, sleep, and diet, but through rapid adjustment and habit solidification, you established a new balance by month-end.\n\n**Personalized Insights**\n\n1.  **Social Light Activity ↔ Mental Health**: Data indicates that \"accompanying walks\", combining social interaction with light physical activity, provided significant mental health benefits for both you and your father. After initiating this habit on Mar 25, your father's mood noticeably brightened, and your own sense of stress eased thereafter. This suggests that for you, integrating health activities with family responsibility and emotional connection is a sustainable and effective strategy.\n2.  **High-Intensity Life Events ↔ Physiological Metrics**: This month's data clearly demonstrates the chain effect of \"major life stress\" on the body: **Stress/Anxiety Period (pre-trip) → Weight increase, poor sleep**; **High-Intensity Physical Exertion Period (relocation) → Weight decrease, extreme fatigue**. This indicates the need for conscious management during similar future events: controlling emotional eating during stress periods and ensuring nutritional intake and sleep during exertion periods to buffer the impact on physiological metrics.\n3.  **Regular Routine Habits ↔ Overall Health**: Despite a complex month, you successfully established and maintained daily micro-habits like skincare and parent-child listening. Data shows these controllable, regular habits served as \"stability anchors\" during the turbulent month, helping maintain basic order and a sense of achievement, positively contributing to the overall mental health score.\n4.  **Creative Leisure Activities ↔ Stress Recovery**: Participating in church choir rehearsal on Mar 26, and successful baking sessions on Mar 14 & 29 – these creative, immersive activities unrelated to your main work corresponded on the data timeline with decreases in stress levels and increases in positive mood. This suggests that for you, regularly engaging in focused manual or artistic activities is an effective method for mental relaxation and stress recovery.\n\n**Abnormal Event Summary**\n\n1.  **High-Intensity Physical Labor Event**:\n    *   **Event**: Assisted parents with relocation, March 20th-22nd.\n    *   **Time**: March 20th to 22nd, lasting 3 days.\n    *   **Impact**: Completely disrupted daily routine; sleep onset early but quality questionable; diet extremely irregular, likely insufficient daily caloric intake; weight decreased 0.9kg over 3 days; body experienced extreme fatigue.\n    *   **Recovery Status**: Post-event, through assisting with settling on 23rd-24th and establishing regular visiting/walking routine from 25th, life rhythm largely stabilized by 28th. Weight stabilized after a slight late-month rebound.\n2.  **Work Stress Leading to Routine Disruption Events**:\n    *   **Event**: Pre-trip anxiety and store review leading to late sleep.\n    *   **Time**: e.g., March 3rd, 5th, 15th, 17th.\n    *   **Impact**: Resulted in poor next-day mental state, affecting work efficiency and emotional stability, creating short-term negative cycles.\n    *   **Recovery Measures & Effect**: By resolving events (completing trip, finishing review) and proactively scheduling relaxing activities (weekend family meals, movies), the anxiety-late sleep cycle was broken, achieving a more stable routine by month-end.\n3.  **Mood Fluctuation Event**:\n    *   **Event**: Low mood on March 18th due to work/sales pressure and concern for father's emotional state.\n    *   **Time**: Evening of March 18th until bedtime.\n    *   **Impact**: No active exercise that day, resting heart rate likely elevated.\n    *   **Recovery Measures & Effect**: Effective communication with husband that evening provided emotional support and stress relief. Mood quickly improved the next day (Mar 19) by adjusting work tasks (sketching window display) and deciding to join choir for distraction. This demonstrates your good emotional regulation skills and the importance of your support system.",

Good start, establishing morning walking rhythm.\n    *   **Week 2 (8th-14th)**: 3 sessions (2 brisk walks, 1 walk), 125 minutes. Exercise volume decreased 42% week-on-week, primarily affected by ankle sprain on 8th, entering recovery adjustment period.\n    *   **Week 3 (15th-21st)**: 4 sessions (3 brisk walks, 1 indoor stretch), 160 minutes. Exercise volume increased 28% week-on-week, ankle gradually recovering, exercise intensity and duration cautiously increased.\n    *   **Week 4 (22nd-30th)**: 11 sessions (7 brisk walks, 3 walks, 1 yoga), 280 minutes. Exercise volume significantly increased 75% week-on-week, reaching monthly peak. Foot injury healed, exercise confidence restored, and new exercise forms attempted.\n*   **Training Cycle Peaks/Lows**:\n    *   **Peak Week**: Week 4, exercise frequency and duration both peaked, with addition of parent-child yoga, highest exercise enthusiasm and diversity.\n    *   **Low Week**: Week 2, due to sudden ankle sprain, exercise count and duration were the lowest for the month.\n*   **Exercise Performance Changes**: Brisk walking average heart rate showed a trend of \"increase - interruption due to injury - gradual decrease after recovery.\" From approx. 140 bpm in Weeks 1-2, decreasing to 130-132 bpm by Week 4, indicating possible improvement in cardiorespiratory efficiency with resumed regular training.\n\n**3.2 Health Trends**\n*   **Sleep Trends**: Sleep duration showed cyclical fluctuations, generally better on weekends than workdays. Week 2 (8th-14th) had 3 days with bedtime later than 23:30 due to foot injury discomfort, unexpected overtime, and study pressure, possibly affecting sleep quality. Week 4, although busy, had relatively stable sleep quality due to strong sense of achievement and positive emotions.\n*   **Physical Health Trends**: Weight fluctuated between 49.8kg and 50.9kg, overall trend stable with slight decrease. Small peak in weight occurred in Week 3 (50.8-50.9kg), related to family gathering on 15th and Easter dinner on 20th, followed by weight decrease in subsequent week through resumed exercise and dietary attention.\n*   **Mental Health Trends**: Stress levels and mood showed clear \"event-driven\" fluctuations. Weeks 2-3 had higher stress levels and moods mixed with \"frustration,\" \"worry\" due to multiple factors: injury, parental health, work/study. Week 4 saw stress relief and moods dominated by \"joy,\" \"pride,\" \"contentment\" as matters were resolved and community class succeeded.\n*   **Injury Impact**: Left ankle sprain on April 8th directly affected Week 2 exercise plan, causing a 4-day break, and requiring adjusted exercise intensity (slower pace) at the start of Week 3. Returned to normal exercise routine around April 18th.\n\n**3.3 Life Rhythm Trends**\n*   **Sleep Schedule & Mental State**: Data shows that on days following bedtime later than 23:30 (e.g., 3rd, 14th), the frequency of keywords like \"fatigue\" in the day's description increased, and exercise willingness or efficiency may have decreased (e.g., canceled morning walks on 8th, 22nd).\n*   **Work/Life Rhythm Changes**: Week 3 had high work/study intensity (parents' open day, parents' check-up, tax research), squeezing some personal relaxation time, leading to brief stress accumulation. Week 4 life rhythm leaned more towards social and community activities (summit, friend gatherings, community class), providing strong mental reward, effectively counterbalancing work pressure.\n\n**Personalized Insights**\n\n*   **Sleep ↔ Exercise Performance**: Data indicates that when you maintain the morning brisk walking habit (e.g., Week 4), daytime mental state tends more towards \"energetic,\" \"positive,\" aiding in managing busy store operations and family affairs. Conversely, when exercise is interrupted (e.g., Week 2), mentions of \"fatigue\" during the day increase.\n*   **Family Interaction/Stress ↔ Health**: Deep family interactions (e.g., picnic on 6th, parent-child yoga on 25th, family visit on 27th) have a significantly positive impact on your emotional health, with mood tags like \"warm,\" \"content,\" \"joy\" appearing at a 100% rate on those days. Concerns related to parents' health (17th) directly lead to increased stress and emotional tension, highlighting the significant impact of family responsibility on your mental health.\n*   **Exercise Type ↔ Physical State**: Regular morning brisk walking (≥3 times/week, ≥30 minutes/session) is the foundation for maintaining your weight stability (monthly fluctuation <1kg) and daytime energy. The newly introduced family parent-child yoga is not just exercise but is viewed by you as \"high-quality parent-child interaction and emotional relaxation,\" achieving dual empowerment of exercise and family relationships.\n*   **Behavioral Habits ↔ Overall Health**: Extending health focus from personal to family (e.g., researching healthy recipes for parents, establishing family health fund) significantly enhanced your sense of \"responsibility\" and \"relief,\" constituting an important internal driver for your improved mental health score this month. Simultaneously, the \"sense of achievement\" and \"community connection\" from successfully leading the community public welfare class (28th) is a key socio-psychological factor in boosting your overall life satisfaction at month-end.\n\n**Abnormal Event Summary**\n\n*   **Injury Event**:\n    *   **Event**: Minor left ankle sprain.\n    *   **Time**: April 8th.\n    *   **Impact**: Directly caused suspension of exercise plan from April 8th-11th, sharp decrease in Week 2 exercise volume.

Focus: habit initiation.\n    *   **Week 2 (Jun 8-14)**: 0 exercise sessions (primary exercise days interrupted by business trip). Exercise volume decreased **100% MoW**. However, non-exercise steps maintained due to business trip and community activities.\n    *   **Week 3 (Jun 15-21)**: 2 exercise sessions (1 brisk walk + 1 5 km run). Exercise volume **significantly rebounded MoW**. Reasons: business trip ended, family matters prompted greater health focus, compensated with brisk walking.\n    *   **Week 4 (Jun 22-28)**: 2 exercise sessions (1 5 km run + 1 long walk). Exercise performance peaked this month: completing 5 km run more comfortably, and single-day step count reached monthly high.\n*   **Training Cycle Peaks/Valleys**:\n    *   **Peak Week**: Week 4. Best exercise performance (comfortable 5 km run), and exercise integrated with leisure (anniversary walk), high physical/mental enjoyment.\n    *   **Valley Week**: Week 2. Exercise plan completely interrupted due to objective reasons (business trip), a key challenge during habit formation.\n*   **Exercise Performance Changes**: Running distance steadily increased from 3 km to 5 km, with reduced subjective fatigue post-run, indicating **progressive weekly improvement in cardiorespiratory endurance and muscular adaptation**. This progress is related to the weekly 1-2 session training frequency and good recovery (sleep, nutrition).\n\n**3.2 Health Trends**\n*   **Sleep Trend**: Weeks 1 & 2 had shorter sleep duration (~6.5 hours) and average quality due to studying/business trip. Weeks 3 & 4 showed **progressive weekly improvement** in sleep duration and quality (especially deep sleep perception) as exercise habit solidified and family matters were settled. Weekend compensatory sleep was effective.\n*   **Physical Health Trends**:\n    *   Weight showed a \"**declining amidst fluctuations**\" trend: stable Week 1, temporary rise in Week 2 (50.3kg) due to business trip eating out,回落 in Week 3, steadily decreased to 49.5kg in Week 4 with exercise and regular diet.\n    *   Body fat percentage trend largely synchronized with weight. Resting heart rate (estimate) showed a slow declining trend after regular exercise.\n*   **Mental Health Trends**:\n    *   Stress levels showed two minor peaks: late Week 2 (post-business trip return to work, customer complaint) and early Week 4 (charity sale prep, multi-tasking).\n    *   Emotional highs strongly correlated with family events (daughter's graduation, parents' move, anniversary) and achievement events (successful charity sale). Data shows **days following exercise generally had higher same-day mood scores**.\n*   **Injury Impact**: No major injury events this month.\n\n**3.3 Lifestyle Rhythm Trends**\n*   **Sleep Schedule & Mental State**: Data indicates that **on days following bedtime past 23:30, self-described mental state was often \"slightly fatigued,\" with potentially reduced patience and energy reserves for handling complex tasks (e.g., customer complaints)**. Conversely, days following regular early sleep/rise had higher morning run execution rates and work efficiency.\n*   **Work/Life Rhythm Changes**:\n    *   Week 2 work rhythm was intense due to business trip, creating a crowding-out effect on exercise.\n    *   Weeks 3-4 life rhythm was dense with major events (parents' long-term stay decision, daughter's graduation, anniversary, charity sale), presenting a \"family affairs peak.\" However, effective management through advance planning (e.g., sending daughter to Quanzhou, batch baking) was observed. Although busy, a sense of achievement offset some stress.\n\n**Module 4: Personalized Insights**\n*   **Sleep ↔ Exercise Performance**: Data shows that when you **sleep late (>23:30) the previous night, willingness and actual completion rate of the next morning's run plan significantly decrease** (e.g., no morning runs after June 6th, 17th). Conversely, **on days completing a morning run, falling asleep that night was easier, with positive subjective evaluation of sleep quality**, forming a positive feedback loop.\n*   **Business Trip/Stress ↔ Health**: **The impact pattern of short business trips (Jun 9-11) on you is: exercise interruption → increased difficulty in dietary control → temporary weight gain of 0.5kg → rapid recovery post-return through adjustment**. Work stress events (e.g., June 12th customer complaint) can trigger emotional eating tendencies, causing slight same-day weight gain, but you quickly alleviated stress through proactive problem-solving and social support.\n*   **Exercise Type ↔ Physical State**: For you, **low-to-moderate intensity aerobic jogging (within 5 km) is the \"sweet spot\" exercise for elevating mood, improving sleep, and not causing excessive fatigue**. **Long-distance walking (e.g., June 28th 12,000 steps) achieves considerable exercise expenditure during leisure and brings high愉悦感**, representing a sustainable form of activity.\n*   **Behavioral Habits ↔ Overall Health**: **The combination of \"morning run + friend socialization\" had a 100% success rate for your habit adherence**, with social commitment greatly enhancing the stickiness of the exercise behavior. **Applying personal skills (baking) to serve the community (church charity sale) brought you unexpected levels of achievement and mental health benefits**, which may be a stronger health driver than mere weight numbers. Data shows that **when screen time is used for active learning (clothing, marketing, baking), even if leading to later sleep, the resulting anxiety is lower than from passive entertainment.**\n\n**Module 5: Anomaly Event Summary**\n*   **Exercise Break Events**:\n    *   **Time**: June 9th - 11th (3 days total).\n    *   **Cause**: Attending Summer Order Fair in Guangzhou, tight work schedule.\n    *   **Impact**: Caused interruption of that week's morning run plan.\n    *   **Recovery**: After returning on June 11th, although running didn't resume immediately, transition was made via active brisk walking on June 16th, and morning run successfully resumed on June 19th with unaffected performance.\n*   **Health Metric Sudden Change Events**:\n    *   **Event**: Temporary weight increase.\n    *   **Time & Magnitude**: June 10th, weight reached monthly peak of 50.3kg, an increase of 0.4kg from the previous day.\n    *   **Cause**: Eating out during business trip, increased difficulty in dietary control, likely exceeding calorie intake.\n    *   **Subsequent Change**: Weight quickly dropped to 50.2kg after returning on June 11th, and through subsequent week's dietary attention and exercise, weight returned to a declining trend.\n*   **Lifestyle Rhythm Anomaly Events**:\n    *   **Event 1: Staying up late preparing for community activities**\n        *   **Time**: June 17th, June 25th.\n        *   **Cause**: Setting up parents' room and testing charity sale pastries, respectively.\n        *   **Impact**: Resulted in sleep duration less than 6.5 hours those nights, slight fatigue the next day.\n        *   **Recovery Measures**: No high-intensity work scheduled the next day; adjusted through daily activity; sleep duration returned to normal within the following two days.\n    *   **Event 2: Emotional Eating**\n        *   **Time**: Evening of June 12th.\n        *   **Cause**: Psychological stress release after handling a customer complaint.\n        *   **Impact**: Consumed extra snacks that night, leading to slight weight gain the next day.\n        *   **Recovery Measures**: After recognizing this pattern, when encountering subsequent stress, you tended to **replace eating with communicating with friends or planning new goals (e.g",

Diet structure leaned towards high-carb (enjoys baking, pastries), low frequency of takeout (~4 times), primarily home-cooked meals. Estimated average daily water intake below 1.5L, room for improvement.\n    *   **Key Events**: Fitness milestone (Aug 30th family swim); Significant health indicator change (persistent insomnia starting Aug 15th); Major life changes (Aug 15th renovation notice, Aug 22nd family team formation).\n    *   **Core Focus Areas**: Sleep quality, stress management, online transition progress.\n\n**Monthly Trend Analysis**\n\n**3.1 Activity Trends**\n*   **Weekly Activity Volume Changes**:\n    *   **Week 1 (1st-7th)**: 5 activity sessions, primarily brisk walking and strolling, initiated running. Activity volume moderate, adaptation period.\n    *   **Week 2 (8th-14th)**: 4 activity sessions, frequency slightly decreased due to insurance matters, gatherings, etc., breaks occurred.\n    *   **Week 3 (15th-21st)**: 3 activity sessions, monthly low point. Directly impacted by Aug 15th renovation notice, energy focused on coping with pressure and preparing for negotiations, activity sidelined.\n    *   **Week 4 (22nd-31st)**: 9 activity sessions, monthly peak. After successful negotiation, emotional release, activity motivation significantly recovered, and new forms like swimming, regular power walking were attempted.\n*   **Training Cycle Peaks/Valleys**:\n    *   **Peak Week**: Week 4, highest number of sessions, diverse types, accompanied by positive mood, high activity quality.\n    *   **Valley Week**: Week 3, lowest number of sessions, and activity performance affected (e.g., abandoned brisk walk midway on Aug 13th).\n*   **Activity Performance Changes**: Running performance noticeably affected by mental state. During lower-stress Week 1 (e.g., Aug 5th run with friend), could complete 4km, whereas during high-pressure Week 3, could not maintain regular brisk walking. By month's end with improved mood, activity sustainability enhanced.\n\n**3.2 Health Trends**\n*   **Sleep Trends**:\n    *   Weeks 1-2: Sleep basically normal, occasional late nights.\n    *   Week 3 (15th-21st): Sleep duration and quality significantly deteriorated, difficulty falling asleep and light sleep became常态, completely overlapping with high-pressure period.\n    *   Week 4 (22nd-31st): As pressure event (negotiation) resolved and proactive relaxation (swimming, meditation) implemented, sleep condition gradually improved, bedtime earlier, quality recovered.\n*   **Physical Health Trends**:\n    *   **Weight**: Trend of \"mid-month increase, end-of-month return.\" Weight rose to monthly high (50.1kg) during Weeks 2-3, related to stress eating (e.g., binge snacking on Aug 4th) and reduced activity; returned to 49.0kg in Week 4 through adjustment.\n    *   **Resting Heart Rate & HRV (inferred)**: Negatively correlated with stress trend. Estimated higher resting heart rate, lower HRV in Week 3; trend reversed in Week 4.\n*   **Mental Health Trends**:\n    *   **Stress**: Stable early month, spiked mid-month (15th) and remained high until 22nd, then rapidly declined due to positive events like successful negotiation, team formation, pre-sales orders.\n    *   **Mood**: Fluctuated closely with stress curve, but obtained multiple buffers and boosts from family support (Qixi Festival, family day), friendship companionship (birthday gathering), hobbies (baking, piano).\n    *   **Activity & Mental Health Correlation**: Data shows when weekly activity sessions ≥4 (e.g., Week 4), number of days with positive mood that week significantly increased.\n*   **Injury Impact**: No recorded exercise-related injuries this month.\n\n**3.3 Life Rhythm Trends**\n*   **Sleep Schedule & Mental State**: Days following bedtime after 23:30 often accompanied by descriptions like \"fatigued,\" \"low energy\" (e.g., Aug 5th, 19th), directly leading to activity plan cancellation or underperformance.\n*   **Work/Life Rhythm Changes**:\n    *   **Work Intensity**: Highest from late Week 2 through Week 3, involving insurance decisions, transition learning, negotiation preparation, occupying大量 personal time and rest.\n    *   **Life Changes**: Daughter's school start and neighbor's assistance in Week 4 fixed daily schedule, reduced time pressure, creating conditions for regular activity.\n\n**Personalized Insights**\n\n*   **Sleep ↔ Activity Performance**: Data shows when your previous night's sleep quality was poor (e.g., Aug 5th, 13th), the next morning's activity plan was more likely to be canceled or abandoned midway. Conversely, during periods of better sleep (e.g., month's end), you could persist with earlier wake-up (5:00) for morning runs. This indicates your activity execution is highly sensitive to sleep quality.\n*   **Travel/Pressure ↔ Health**: The \"Quanzhou family visit,\" though only 1 day, as a positive life event, effectively interrupted anxious rumination, brought significant mood boost and sense of family belonging. Its immediate psychological benefits far outweighed minor disruption to schedule. Data shows sustained high-pressure periods (stress level ≥7/10) exceeding 5 days systematically affect sleep, appetite (weight increase), and activity motivation.\n*   **Activity Type ↔ Physical State**: Comparison reveals social activities (e.g., running with friend, strolling with father) were easier to execute during stress periods and served dual emotional support function. Newly introduced \"swimming\" and \"piano\" this month were recorded as having \"good relaxation effect,\" \"brought flow experience,\" acting as purer stress relievers. Recommended as fixed items for high-pressure buffering.\n*   **Behavioral Habits ↔ Overall Health**: You demonstrated a strong \"action alleviates anxiety\" pattern this month. Whether establishing a family \"emergency fund,\" completing \"insurance enrollment,\" or translating \"online transition\" into concrete plans and team division, each complete action plan and execution brought clear提升 in sense of control and health score recovery. This confirms that, for you, transforming uncertainty into concrete action steps is a core pathway to maintaining mental health.\n\n**Abnormal Event Summary**\n\n*   **Activity Break Event**:\n    *   **Event**: Consecutive interruption of activity plans.\n    *   **Time**: August 13th to 14th.\n    *   **Impact**: Led weekly activity volume to hit bottom, accompanied by low mood and negative feedback like baking failure.\n    *   **Recovery**: Although still under high pressure after Aug 15th, maintained minimum activity through evening strolls, and fully recovered surpassing previous levels in Week 4.\n*   **Significant Health Indicator Change Event**:\n    *   **Event**: Persistent difficulty falling asleep and light sleep.\n    *   **Time**: Started night of August 15th, persisted until around August 22nd.\n    *   **Impact**: Caused daytime fatigue, decreased energy, hindered activity plans, and likely elevated resting heart rate.\n    *   **Recovery**: Through坚持 foot soaks, learning progressive muscle relaxation, seeking doctor's advice, and after stressor (negotiation) resolved, sleep issues gradually eased starting Aug 23rd, established pre-sleep meditation habit by month's end to consolidate results.\n*   **Life Rhythm Abnormal Event**:\n    *   **Event**: High-intensity work and anxiety period.\n    *   **Time**: August 15th to August 22nd.\n    *   **Impact**: Disrupted sleep schedule (late nights), screen time surged (learning, preparation), leisure activity几乎 stopped, overall life rhythm revolved around single pressure event.\n    *   **Recovery Measures & Effect**: Through \"family team meeting\" (22nd) to分解 pressure, successful \"rent negotiation\" (30th) to eliminate uncertainty, and引入 \"neighbor's help\" (24th) to减轻 daily burden, life rhythm returned to balance by month's end, establishing healthier work-life boundaries.",

Motivation came from health awakening and new social circle.\n    *   **Week 3 (9/15-21)**: Exercise volume remained high (7 sessions), running duration and frequency stable, practicing for badminton match.\n    *   **Week 4 (9/22-30)**: Exercise volume slightly decreased due to busy promotion and ankle sprain (6 sessions), but running performance (pace) peaked.\n*   **Training Cycle Peaks/Troughs**:\n    *   **Peak Week**: Week 4, fastest running pace, highest exercise efficiency, stemming from body's adaptation to sustained training.\n    *   **Trough Days**: Early Week 2 (September 11th-12th), exercise experience difficult due to muscle soreness and staying up late, but you persevered.\n*   **Exercise Performance Changes**: Running pace showed a **clear weekly improvement curve**, from approx. 9'00\"/km in Week 2 to approx. 7'30\"/km in Week 4. Decrease in heart rate and faster post-run recovery confirmed cardiovascular improvement.\n\n**3.2 Health Trends**\n*   **Sleep Trend**: Starting Week 2 with foot soaking, sleep duration and quality steadily improved. During Week 4 promotion period, although occasional late nights, deep sleep percentage remained stable with foot soaking. Few sleep interruptions throughout the month, continuity good.\n*   **Physical Health Trend**: Weight and body fat percentage showed a **steady downward trend**, no sharp fluctuations, indicating healthy weight loss method. Resting heart rate fluctuated slightly mid-month due to initial exercise phase, showed downward trend by month-end as fitness improved. HRV data inversely correlated with rest quality and stress cycles.\n*   **Mental Health Trend**: Stress levels peaked at **work critical points (negotiation, promotion)**. Emotional state positively correlated with exercise frequency; Weeks 2 and 3 with high exercise volume had high proportion of positive mood tags. After September 24th physical exam, health responsibility increased, mindset became more positive.\n*   **Injury Impact**: September 28th mild right ankle sprain led to pausing running/jumping exercises for the next two days, but did not affect daily activities or family plans, expected to recover quickly.\n\n**3.3 Life Rhythm Trends**\n*   **Routine & Mental State**: Data shows that **on days you fell asleep before 23:00, your self-evaluated mental state the next day was higher, and exercise completion and store operation efficiency were also better**. For example, after early sleep on September 10th, the next day's morning run started more smoothly.\n    *   **Work/Life Rhythm Changes**: Week 4 was a \"high-work-pressure period\" (Mid-Autumn promotion). You successfully balanced high-intensity work with health maintenance through advance planning (materials, promotion) and using morning exercise to maintain energy. Life changes (e.g., attending salon) brought new social support and industry perspective.\n\n**Personalized Insights**\n\n1.  **Sleep ↔ Exercise Performance**: Data shows that **on days following your pre-sleep foot soaking (deep relaxation), your morning run average pace improved by 0'15\"-0'30\"**, and subjective feeling was easier. Conversely, after staying up late during promotion periods (e.g., September 12th, 26th), even when completing exercise, heart rate was 5-8 bpm higher than usual. **High-quality sleep is an \"efficiency booster\" for your exercise performance**.\n2.  **Travel/Pressure ↔ Health**: During the retreat (low-pressure environment), your sleep duration increased by 0.5 hours, morning resting heart rate decreased by 3 bpm. During the high-pressure promotion week (September 22nd-26th), although exercise persisted, weight loss speed slightly slowed, **suggesting chronic stress may mildly affect metabolic efficiency**. Your strategy of actively managing stress through exercise is effective.\n3.  **Exercise Type ↔ Physical State**: Comparison reveals that **in weeks with ≥2 running sessions, your weight showed a clear downward trend** (e.g., Weeks 3, 4). Whereas **social or relaxing exercises like badminton/yoga significantly boosted your mood score and sense of community belonging**. The combination of both constitutes your optimal health promotion mix.\n4.  **Behavioral Habits ↔ Overall Health**: **The overlap between foot soaking habit and early sleep (<23:30) days was as high as 85%**. Under the combined effect of these two, your monthly health score increased approx. 15 points. **After replacing entertainment reading with industry reading, you not only gained knowledge but also advanced your daily \"screen use end time\" by an average of 40 minutes, indirectly promoting sleep**. The high proportion of homemade meals (≥22 days) was an important foundation for your healthy body fat percentage decrease.\n\n**Abnormal Event Summary**\n\n1.  **Injury Event**:\n    *   **Time & Type**: September 28th, mild right ankle sprain during community badminton match.\n    *   **Impact Scope**: Led to pausing running/jumping exercises on September 28th-29th, switched to rest and light activity.\n    *   **Recovery Status**: Immediate icing after sprain, pain significantly reduced within 24 hours. By September 30th, daily walking was unimpeded, not expected to affect low-intensity exercise resumption in early October. This event reminded you of the importance of pre-exercise warm-up and equipment professionalism.\n2.  **Exercise Break Events**:\n    *   **Break Times & Reasons**: First (September 5th-7th), due to attending retreat, actively adjusted exercise form. Second (September 27th-29th), due to promotion wrap-up, Mid-Autumn family dinner prep, and ankle sprain.\n    *   **Post-Break Recovery**: After each break, you quickly returned to exercise rhythm, no habit disruption occurred. This indicates your exercise motivation has internalized into a lifestyle habit, not a short-term task.\n3.  **Health Indicator Alert Event**:\n    *   **Alert Indicator & Time**: September 24th, physical exam report indicated \"tendency towards mild fatty liver\".\n    *   **Alert Cause**: Related to past dietary structure and lack of effective exercise.\n    *   **Subsequent Changes**: This result became a strong catalyst for you to strengthen health management. You immediately consulted a doctor, held a family meeting, and formulated an action plan, elevating health focus from the \"feeling\" level to the \"indicator\" level. This was a successful health crisis warning and response.\n4.  **Life Rhythm Anomaly Events**:\n    *   **Anomaly Periods**: September 12th, September 22nd, September 26th.\n    *   **Anomaly Type**: Staying up late (bedtime >23:50) due to work (lesson prep, salon, promotion).\n    *   **Impact**: Next day's morning run felt more strenuous, daytime concentration slightly decreased.\n    *   **Recovery Measures**: You compensated and adjusted by strictly implementing foot soaking routine on subsequent nights and planning work in advance, typically returning to normal routine rhythm within 1-2 days.",

With improved aerobic capacity, may have decreased by **3-5 bpm** by month-end compared to month-start. Highest values likely occurred on high-work-stress days (e.g., 7th, 22nd).\n    *   **HRV (Heart Rate Variability, Inferred):** Daily average at moderate level. **Lowest values** likely during high-work-pressure periods (e.g., 7th-8th, rent payment, operation planning); **Highest values** occurred post-retreat and after achieving exercise goals (e.g., 19th, 23rd), indicating effective stress relief and recovery.\n*   **Mental Health:**\n    *   **Stress:** Daily average stress level ~**5/10**. Notable fluctuations: High-stress periods were **October 7th-8th, 22nd, 29th-30th**, with stress sources being \"store lease renewal and planning\", \"mini-program launch decision\", \"pre-launch technical coordination and anxiety\", stress levels up to 7/10. Low-stress periods were during the retreat and after the sharing session, stress levels down to 2-3/10.\n    *   **Mood:** Predominant mood tags were **\"fulfilled\", \"anticipatory\", \"peaceful\"**, overall positive. Fluctuation periods: Early month holiday \"joyful, content\"; Mid-month work period \"slightly anxious, tired\"; Post-retreat \"calm, enriched\"; End-of-month pre-launch \"anticipatory, slightly nervous\".\n    *   **Health Score (Inferred):** Daily average score ~78 points.

Highest weekly step count likely during National Day Quanzhou trip week (Week 1), lowest during work-intensive, low-exercise Week 4.\n    *   Commute Mode: Walking or driving. From home address (Hubin South Road) to store (Zhongshan Road), one-way distance ~**2-3 km**, average daily commute time ~**20-30 minutes**.\n    *   Business Trip/Travel: 1 instance, Quanzhou nostalgia trip on October 4th (same-day return). Impact: No structured exercise that day, but high step count; Sleep earlier and of higher quality due to fatigue.\n*   **Daily Life:**\n    *   Screen Usage: Average daily duration ~**6-7 hours** (Work: 4-5 hours, for customer communication, online operations, financial tasks; Entertainment: 2-3 hours). Peak days may exceed 8 hours (e.g., promotional material creation, technical communication days).\n    *   Dietary Habits: Three-meal regularity relatively high, ~**25 days regular**, irregularity mainly during holidays (6th) and outings (25th). Dietary structure leans towards **high-carb** (preference for Minnan noodles, pastries), but conscious effort this month to control dessert intake during gatherings (27th). Takeout meals ~8-10 times, home-cooked meals dominant. Average daily water intake ~**1.5L**.\n\n### **Module 3: Monthly Trend Analysis**\n\n#### **3.1 Exercise Trends**\n*   **Weekly Exercise Volume Changes:**\n    *   Week 1 (1st-6th): 2 exercise sessions (running), initiation phase, includes rest and family activities due to holiday.\n    *   Week 2 (7th-13th): 5 exercise sessions (running 4 times + badminton 1 time), **150% increase month-over-month**. Reason: Holiday ended, work rhythm resumed, and participated in community activity.\n    *   Week 3 (14th-20th): 4 exercise sessions (running 3 times + yoga 1 time), 20% decrease month-over-month. Reason: Included retreat weekend (18th-19th no exercise), but exercise quality high (including 5km breakthrough).\n    *   Week 4 (21st-31st): 5 exercise sessions (running 4 times + yoga 2 times), **25% increase month-over-month**. Reason: To prepare for November launch, used exercise to maintain energy, and persisted with yoga to alleviate sedentary fatigue.\n*   **Training Cycle Peaks/Valleys:**\n    *   **Peak Week:** Week 4. Performance: Completed first-ever 5km run (23rd), running pace stable, and maintained two yoga sessions. Trigger: Post-retreat peaceful mindset, strong sense of purpose.\n    *   **Valley Day/Week:** Latter half of Week 1 (2nd-3rd) and weekend of Week 3 (18th-19th). Manifested as exercise gaps. Triggers: Active recovery, social activities, and retreat schedule.\n*   **Exercise Performance Changes:**\n    *   Running pace improved steadily from ~8'00\"/km in Week 1 to ~7'35\"/km in Week 4, indicating **significant enhancement in cardiorespiratory endurance**. Pace improvement positively correlated with accumulated weekly training load of 3-4 sessions, with recovery runs after rest days (e.g., retreat) showing particularly good form.\n\n#### **3.2 Health Trends**\n*   **Sleep Trends:**\n    *   Weeks 1 & 2: Sleep duration highly variable, influenced by holidays and initial work stress, deep sleep continuity average.\n    *   Week 3: **Best sleep quality.** During retreat (18th-19th), sleep duration sufficient and quality high, attributed to relaxing environment and psychological release.\n    *   Week 4: Sleep duration somewhat compressed, **bedtime delayed**. Reason: Final preparations and communication for mini-program launch led to mental excitement and anxiety. Deep sleep percentage likely partially maintained due to pre-bed yoga and foot soaks.\n*   **Physical Health Trends:**\n    *   **Weight & Body Fat Percentage:** Overall **slow decreasing trend**. Slight rebound in Week 2 due to holiday, continued decrease in Weeks 3 & 4 with regular exercise and dietary control. **Data shows that when weekly running distance exceeded 15km, weight showed a decrease that week.**\n    *   **Resting Heart Rate & HRV:** **The two show an inverse correlation trend.** During high-work-pressure weeks (e.g., Weeks 2, 4), inferred resting heart rate was higher, HRV lower; During recovery/retreat weeks and after exercise breakthroughs (Week 3 weekend, mid-Week 4), resting heart rate decreased, HRV increased.\n*   **Mental Health Trends:**\n    *   Stress levels showed a wavelike pattern of \"**high pressure - release - steady - pre-event anxiety**\". In weeks with high exercise frequency (e.g., Weeks 2, 4), stress had an outlet; however, major decision points (22nd) and pre-launch eve (30th) still triggered significant anxiety. The retreat (Week 3) brought deep stress release and emotional reset.\n*   **Injury Impact:**\n    *   Shoulder/neck discomfort, as a persistent sub-health condition, was identified after the October 9th physical exam, and yoga intervention began on the 16th. **Data shows that during weeks when shoulder/neck yoga was performed, reports of discomfort decreased**, but not completely eliminated, requiring ongoing intervention.\n\n#### **3.3 Life Rhythm Trends**\n*   **Sleep/Wake & Mental State:** Data indicates that **on days following a bedtime later than 23:30, morning runs felt more effortful subjectively, and more coffee was needed for daytime alertness**. For example, after staying up late on October 8th, the morning run on the 9th was completed but felt \"fatigued\".\n*   **Work/Life Rhythm Changes:**\n    *   Work intensity significantly increased during **Week 2 (post-holiday planning) and Week 4 (launch sprint)**, directly leading to encroachment on exercise time (1-day gap in Week 2) and delayed sleep time (multiple late nights in Week 4).\n    *   Life changes such as the **retreat (Week 3)** and **return to alma mater for sharing (Week 4 weekend)**, while briefly altering the exercise rhythm, had a significantly positive impact on mental health, enhancing overall sense of well-being and value.\n\n### **Module 4: Personalized Insights**\n\n*   **Sleep ↔ Exercise Performance:** Data shows that **when sleep duration ≥7 hours and bedtime is before 23:00, the average pace of the next morning's run can improve by 5-10 seconds/km, and subjective fatigue is reduced**. The inverse correlation also holds: **On days with running distance breakthroughs (e.g., 5km) or higher intensity (pace attempts), the proportion of deep sleep that night may increase**, reflecting the body's need for repair.\n*   **Travel/Pressure ↔ Health:** **The retreat, as a special \"psychological trip\", shows that disengaging from the daily high-pressure environment for 2 days can reduce stress levels by 60% (from 6/10 to 2/10) and significantly elevate the emotional baseline for the following week.** Regular work pressure differs: when self-rated stress levels remain ≥7/10 for 2 consecutive days or more",

Exercise frequency and single-session intensity (completing 5km) peaked. Triggers: seeking outlet post-business pressure, motivation for self-breakthrough, and physical ease post-massage.\n        *   **Valley Week**: Week 4 (latter part of 18th-24th and 25th-30th). Exercise frequency and duration significantly decreased. Triggers: family priority affairs (family portrait, visiting relatives) consuming time, and month-end work review/planning consuming energy.\n    *   **Exercise Performance Changes**: Running distance trended \"low-rise-peak-decline\". Pace was best on the 20th challenge day, showing progressive improvement before. Estimated resting heart rate decreased after the peak exercise week but may have slightly increased when resuming running after fatigue breaks.\n*   **3.2 Health Trends**\n    *   **Sleep Trends**: Sleep duration and deep sleep percentage fluctuated similarly. **Week 2 had the shortest sleep duration (~6.5 hours) and likely the lowest estimated deep sleep percentage (~16%)**, affected by launch and Double 11 high stress. Gradual recovery in Weeks 3 & 4, with clear weekend catch-up effect. Sleep interruptions were more frequent during high-stress weeks.\n    *   **Physiological Health Trends**:\n        *   Weight curve showed \"gradual decline → sharp rise from gathering → rapid adjustment → steady decline\". The 22nd gathering was a mutation point, followed by recovery within 2-3 days via daily activity and dietary control.\n        *   Estimated resting heart rate highly synchronized with stress cycles, highest in Week 2, lowest at end of Week 4.\n        *   Estimated HRV trended opposite to resting heart rate, showing an upward trend during relaxed, good exercise performance periods (e.g., post-20th, 30th).\n    *   **Mental Health Trends**: Stress values formed a clear peak in Week 2, then gradually declined driven by events like exercise achievement (20th), family warmth (22nd-23rd), and gratitude sharing (27th). Data shows **stress average in high-exercise-frequency Week 3 was 26.5% lower than high-stress Week 2**.\n    *   **Injury Impact**: Lower back strain (6th-15th) directly affected Week 2 and early Week 3, leading to shortened run distance on the 12th, early sleep/rest on the 13th, and prompting professional massage on the 15th. Subsequent exercise paid attention to stretching, eliminating the impact.\n*   **3.3 Life Rhythm Trends**\n    *   **Routine & Mental State**: Strongly correlated. On days with bedtime after 23:30 (e.g., 4th, 5th, 10th, 17th, 18th), records of \"fatigue\", \"anxiety\" the next or same day increased noticeably, and exercise plans were more likely to be canceled or shortened.\n    *   **Work/Life Rhythm Changes**: Week 2 had the highest work intensity (launch, Double 11), directly compressing exercise time, reducing sleep, and causing stress eating (late-night snacks). Week 4 had dense life changes (photo shoot, visiting relatives), also squeezing regular exercise time but providing positive emotional value.\n\n**Module 4: Personalized Insights**\n*   **Sleep ↔ Exercise Performance**: Data shows when your sleep duration ≥ 7.5 hours (often after weekend catch-up), next-day exercise adherence rate was 100%, with subjective feelings of \"feeling good\", \"breathing smoothly\"; whereas after sleep ≤ 6.5 hours and late bedtime (e.g., after 23:30), the probability of canceling or shortening morning runs increased by 80%.\n*   **Business Travel/Stress ↔ Health**: Although no actual travel occurred, the impact pattern of high-pressure work cycles (e.g., project launch, major promotions) on your health is clear: **During periods with stress values ≥ 7/10, average daily sleep duration decreased by 1 hour, estimated HRV decreased by ~10 ms, accompanied by physical signals like \"lower back discomfort\", \"fatigue\"**. You proactively intervened through massage therapy, confiding in close friends, gratitude journaling, etc., effectively cutting off the sustained negative impact chain of stress on health.\n*   **Exercise Type ↔ Physical State**:\n    *   Comparison reveals **in cycles with at least 1 weekly indoor comprehensive training session (including stretching), your reported frequency of \"lower back soreness\" decreased by 50%**. Indicates adding flexibility and core training alongside running has positive effects on alleviating work-related strain from prolonged standing.\n    *   Regarding running load, when weekly running distance exceeded 10km (e.g., Week 3), it was accompanied by weight loss (0.3kg decrease within the week) and significant mood elevation, but sufficient rest should be arranged to prevent cumulative strain.\n*   **Behavioral Habits ↔ Overall Health**:\n    *   **Routine stability is the cornerstone of your overall state**. This month, days with bedtime before 23:00 totaled 18. On the following days, your estimated average health score (7.5) was 10.3% higher than after late-sleep days (6.8).\n    *   **Initial effects of the healthy eating plan are evident**. After plan initiation (starting 17th), your takeout frequency decreased by 75%, weight fluctuation amplitude reduced, and month-end weight decreased by 0.8kg compared to initiation, showing dietary structure adjustment has a direct positive impact on weight management.\n    *   Screen usage time, especially work-related evening screen use, is directly related to delayed sleep onset. Data shows **screen use exceeding 30 minutes after 10 PM on average delayed sleep onset by 25 minutes**.\n\n**Module 5: Anomaly Event Summary**\n*   **Injury Event**:\n    *   **Event**: Mild lower back strain.\n    *   **Timing**: First recorded discomfort on the 6th, persisted until the 15th.\n    *   **Impact**: Forced shortening of running distance to 2km on the 12th, canceled exercise and early sleep on the 13th, with fatigue during the period.\n    *   **Recovery**: Underwent traditional Chinese massage therapy on the 15th with daily stretching advice; proactively adjusted to avoid high impact during exercise on the 18th; discomfort essentially disappeared after the 24th, resuming normal exercise.\n*   **Exercise Break Events**:\n    *   **Break 1**: 6th-7th, 2 days. Reasons: Weather and busy fatigue on the 6th; work pressure and content planning on the 7th.\n    *   **Break 2**: 19th,",

Diet structure primarily Southern Fujian home-style cuisine, with moderate carbohydrate proportion. Takeout/eating out: ~10 times; home-cooked meals: ~21 times. Estimated daily water intake 1.5L. Overall diet is relatively home-style and healthy.\n\n**Monthly Trend Analysis**\n\n**3.1 Activity Trends**\n*   **Weekly Activity Volume Changes**:\n    *   **Week 1 (Dec 1-7)**: Highest activity volume (12 sessions), including morning runs and family hike, building energy for the promotional period.\n    *   **Week 2 (Dec 8-14)**: Sharp decrease in activity (4 sessions), mainly due to business trip and neck/shoulder discomfort, representing the month's activity low point.\n    *   **Week 3 (Dec 15-21)**: Activity volume rebounded (7 sessions), but primarily low-intensity walking and indoor stretching, corresponding to fatigue recovery needs during the clearance sale period.\n    *   **Week 4 (Dec 22-31)**: Activity volume recovered and stabilized (8 sessions), combining morning runs and indoor training, indicating a return to normal life rhythm.\n*   **Training Cycle Peaks/Valleys**:\n    *   **Peak Week**: Week 1, with the highest exercise frequency and motivation, preparing physically for the known busy period.\n    *   **Valley Week**: Week 2, with activity nearly halted due to the dual impact of business travel and physical discomfort.\n*   **Activity Performance Changes**: Your performance does not pursue absolute data breakthroughs but is strongly correlated with life rhythm. You automatically choose low-intensity activities during fatigue periods (e.g., Week 3) and systematically resume training during recovery periods (e.g., Week 4), demonstrating good body intuition and adjustment capability.\n\n**3.2 Health Trends**\n*   **Sleep Trends**: Sleep duration and quality showed cyclical \"weekday compression, weekend compensation\" fluctuations. Sleep duration was compressed in Week 2 (business trip) and the first half of Week 3 (clearance sale start), with deep sleep percentage likely decreasing accordingly. Sleep duration and stability were best during the holiday period in Week 4.\n*   **Physical Health Trends**: The weight curve perfectly reflects your life events: rise at the end of Week 1 (7th, family day), drop in Week 2 (4-5th, business trip), rise in Week 3 (13th, high-pressure clearance sale with eating out), steady decline in Week 4 (after 26th, review/planning period). Changes in resting heart rate and HRV show a clear inverse correlation with stress cycles.\n*   **Mental Health Trends**: Stress levels increased during work peaks in Weeks 1 and 3, and were effectively alleviated by social, family, and faith activities in Weeks 2 and 4. Data indicates that deep socializing (e.g., with close friend), family activities, and faith rituals serve as highly effective pressure release valves for you.\n*   **Injury/Illness Impact**: The \"sub-health\" event this month was persistent neck and shoulder fatigue. Discomfort was noticeable from Dec 8-10, affecting exercise motivation. Through massage therapy on Dec 10th and daily adherence to neck/shoulder exercises after the 18th, this condition was effectively controlled and did not develop into a serious injury.\n\n**3.3 Life Rhythm Trends**\n*   **Sleep Schedule & Mental State**: When your bedtime was later than 23:30, your morning exercise plan for the next day was more likely to be canceled (e.g., Dec 3rd, 8th), and daytime fatigue increased. Conversely, during periods of earlier bedtime (e.g., Week 4 holidays), your energy and mood states were more vibrant.\n*   **Work/Life Rhythm Changes**: Work intensity directly dictates your exercise and sleep duration. \"Work peak events\" like promotions, clearance sales, and business trips all led to exercise breaks and reduced sleep. However, you effectively buffered the impact of work rhythm through advance planning (e.g., Week 1 morning runs for reserve) and subsequent compensation (e.g., family day, bookstore browsing).\n\n**Personalized Insights**\n\n*   **Sleep ↔ Activity Performance**: Data shows that when you ensured weekend sleep compensation (e.g., 7.5 hours on Dec 7th), exercise adherence at the start of the following week (e.g., recovery after Dec 8th) significantly improved. Conversely, after a single day of high-intensity work (e.g., over 8 hours of standing sales), even with free time the next morning, your exercise motivation decreased by over 30%.\n*   **Business Trip/Stress ↔ Health**: Your Guangzhou business trip (Dec 4-6) resulted in 3 consecutive days without formal exercise. Although daily steps were high, mental tension was present, and estimated HRV decreased by ~15%, visually demonstrating how environmental changes and work rhythm disrupt daily health habits. When your stress level increased due to work deadlines (e.g., Dec 13th), weight showed short-term increases due to celebratory meals out, representing your unique stress coping pattern.\n*   **Activity Type ↔ Physical State**: Comparison reveals that **morning runs** are more suitable for starting an energetic workday for you (e.g., Dec 1st, 15th); while **walking and family hikes** served the dual purpose of bonding with family and low-intensity recovery on weekends; **neck & shoulder relief exercises** were your most important health discovery this month, with adherence directly and positively correlated with the alleviation of your neck/shoulder discomfort.\n*   **Behavioral Habits ↔ Overall Health**: **A stable evening sleep schedule** is the foundation of your overall state. When you went to bed before 23:00 for three consecutive days (e.g., Dec 20-22), daytime decision clarity and emotional stability were noticeably better. During cycles where **home-cooked meals** dominated (e.g., Week 4), your weight showed a clearer downward trend. **Deep, high-quality socializing (not casual chat)** like afternoon tea with close friend Li Meiling (Dec 14th) had an effect on boosting your mental health score equivalent to a high-quality moderate-intensity exercise session.\n\n**Anomalous Event Summary**\n\n1.  **Health Metric Sudden Change Events**:\n    *   **Event**: Short-term weight increase.\n    *   **Time**: December 7th, 13th, 20th.\n    *   **Magnitude**: Single-day increase of 0.2-0.3kg.\n    *   **Cause**: Corresponding to family day picnic, celebratory meal out for sales performance, and family dinner respectively, all directly related to increased food intake during social celebration scenarios.\n    *   **Follow-up**: All naturally returned to baseline within 2-3 days through resuming normal diet and activity, representing benign physiological fluctuations.\n2.  **Activity Break Events**:\n    *   **Event**: Consecutive exercise interruption.\n    *   **Time Periods**: December 4-6 (3 days), December 12-14 (3 days).\n    *   **Cause**: First due to business trip, second due to promotion peak period combined with neck/shoulder discomfort and deep social arrangements.\n    *   **Recovery Performance**: After each break, you quickly resumed exercise without significant decline in performance, indicating a good exercise foundation and strong recovery ability.\n3.  **Life Rhythm Anomalous Events**:\n    *   **Event**: Late nights and high-pressure work periods.\n    *   **Time Periods**: December 2-3, December 18-19.\n    *   **Impact**: Average daily sleep below 6.5 hours, screen time over 8 hours, leading to aggravated neck/shoulder fatigue and canceled exercise plans.\n    *   **Recovery Measures & Effect**: Effective recovery through active therapy on Dec 10th, adherence to workplace exercises after the 18th, and weekend family/faith activities. By Week 4, sleep schedule and state had fully returned to normal."
