**Monthly Trend Analysis**

**3.1 Exercise Trends**
*   **Weekly Exercise Volume Changes**:
    *   **Week 1 (Sep 1-7)**: Low exercise volume (3 sessions, mainly walking), due to focus on store renewal and retreat.
    *   **Week 2 (Sep 8-14)**: **Exercise volume surged** (8 sessions), running habit initiated, and badminton, yoga introduced, a 167% increase week-over-week. Motivation came from health awareness and new social circles.
    *   **Week 3 (Sep 15-21)**: Exercise volume remained high (7 sessions), running duration and frequency stabilized, practicing for badminton match.
    *   **Week 4 (Sep 22-30)**: Exercise volume slightly decreased due to busy promotion and ankle sprain (6 sessions), but running performance (pace) peaked.
*   **Training Cycle Peaks/Valleys**:
    *   **Peak Week**: Week 4, fastest running pace, highest exercise efficiency, stemming from body's adaptation to consistent training.
    *   **Valley Days**: Early Week 2 (Sep 11-12), due to muscle soreness and staying up late, exercise experience was difficult, but you persevered.
*   **Exercise Performance Changes**: Running pace showed a **clear weekly improvement curve**, from ~9'00"/km in Week 2 to ~7'30"/km in Week 4. Decreased heart rate and faster post-run recovery confirmed cardiovascular improvement.

**3.2 Health Trends**
*   **Sleep Trend**: Starting Week 2 with foot soaks, sleep duration and quality steadily improved. During Week 4 promotion, although occasional late nights, deep sleep percentage remained stable with foot soaks. Few sleep interruptions all month, good continuity.
*   **Physical Health Trend**: Weight and body fat percentage showed a **steady downward trend**, no drastic fluctuations, indicating healthy weight loss method. Resting heart rate fluctuated slightly mid-month due to initial exercise phase, showing a downward trend by month-end as fitness improved. HRV data inversely correlated with rest quality and stress cycles.
*   **Mental Health Trend**: Stress levels peaked at **work critical points (negotiations, promotions)**. Emotional state positively correlated with exercise frequency; Weeks 2 and 3 with high exercise volume had higher proportions of positive mood tags. After the Sep 24 physical, health responsibility increased, mindset became more positive.
*   **Injury Impact**: Sep 28 mild right ankle sprain led to pausing running/jumping exercises for the next two days, but did not affect daily activities or family plans, expected to recover quickly.

**3.3 Life Rhythm Trends**
*   **Routine & Mental State**: Data shows that **on days you fell asleep before 23:00, your self-assessed mental state the next day was higher, and exercise completion and store operation efficiency were also better**. For example, after early sleep on Sep 10, the next day's morning run started more smoothly.
    *   **Work/Life Rhythm Changes**: Week 4 was a "high-work-pressure period" (Mid-Autumn promotion). You successfully balanced high-intensity work with health maintenance through advance planning (materials, promotion) and using morning exercise to maintain energy. Life changes (e.g., attending salons) brought new social support and industry perspective.

**Personalized Insights**

1.  **Sleep ↔ Exercise Performance**: Data shows that **on days following a pre-sleep foot soak (deep relaxation), your morning run average pace improved by 0'15"-0'30"**, and subjectively felt easier. Conversely, after staying up late during promotion periods (e.g., Sep 12, 26), even if exercise was completed, heart rate was 5-8 bpm higher than usual. **High-quality sleep is an "efficiency booster" for your exercise performance**.
2.  **Business Trip/Stress ↔ Health**: During the retreat (low-stress environment), your sleep duration increased by 0.5 hours, morning resting heart rate decreased by 3 bpm. During the high-stress promotion week (Sep 22-26), although exercise persisted, the rate of weight loss slightly slowed, **suggesting chronic stress may mildly affect metabolic efficiency**. Your strategy of actively managing stress through exercise is effective.
3.  **Exercise Type ↔ Physical State**: Comparison reveals that **in weeks with ≥2 running sessions, your weight showed a clear downward trend** (e.g., Weeks 3, 4). Meanwhile, **social or relaxing exercises like badminton/yoga significantly boosted your mood scores and sense of community belonging**. The combination of both constitutes your optimal health promotion mix.
4.  **Behavioral Habits ↔ Overall Health**: **The overlap between the foot soak habit and early sleep (<23:30) days was as high as 85%**. Under the combined effect of both, your monthly health score increased by ~15 points. **After replacing entertainment reading with industry reading, you not only gained knowledge but also advanced your daily "screen use end time" by an average of 40 minutes, indirectly promoting sleep**. The high proportion of homemade meals (≥22 days) is an important foundation for your healthy body fat percentage decrease.

**Abnormal Event Summary**

1.  **Injury Event**:
    *   **Occurrence Time & Type**: Sep 28, mild right ankle sprain during community badminton match.
    *   **Impact Scope**: Led to pausing running/jumping exercises on Sep 28-29, switching to rest and light activity.
    *   **Recovery Status**: Immediate ice application after sprain, pain significantly reduced within 24 hours. By Sep 30, daily walking was unimpeded, expected not to affect low-intensity exercise resumption in early October. This event reminds you of the importance of pre-exercise warm-up and equipment professionalism.
2.  **Exercise Break Events**:
    *   **Break Times & Reasons**: First (Sep 5-7), due to attending a retreat, actively adjusted exercise form. Second (Sep 27-29), due to promotion wrap-up, Mid-Autumn family dinner prep, and ankle sprain.
    *   **Post-Break Recovery**: After each break, you quickly returned to your exercise rhythm, with no habit disruption. This indicates your exercise motivation has internalized into a lifestyle habit, not a short-term task.
3.  **Health Indicator Alert Event**:
    *   **Alert Indicator & Time**: Sep 24, physical report indicated "tendency towards mild fatty liver".
    *   **Alert Cause**: Related to past dietary structure and lack of effective exercise.
    *   **Subsequent Changes**: This result became a strong catalyst for you to intensify health management. You immediately consulted a doctor, held a family meeting, and formulated an action plan, elevating health focus from the "feeling" level to the "indicator" level. This was a successful health crisis warning and response.
4.  **Life Rhythm Anomaly Events**:
    *   **Anomaly Periods**: Sep 12, Sep 22, Sep 26.
    *   **Anomaly Type**: Staying up late (bedtime >23:50) due to work (lesson prep, salon, promotion).
    *   **Impact**: Next morning's run felt more strenuous, daytime concentration slightly decreased.
    *   **Recovery Measures**: You compensated and adjusted by strictly implementing the foot soak routine on subsequent nights and planning work in advance, typically returning to normal routine rhythm within 1-2 days.
