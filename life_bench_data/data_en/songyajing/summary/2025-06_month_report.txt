**Module 3: Monthly Trend Analysis**

**3.1 Exercise Trends**
*   **Weekly Exercise Volume Changes**:
    *   **Week 1 (Jun 1-7)**: 1 exercise session (first 3 km run). Focus: habit initiation.
    *   **Week 2 (Jun 8-14)**: 0 exercise sessions (primary exercise days interrupted by business trip). Exercise volume **decreased 100% MoW**. However, non-exercise steps maintained due to trip and community activities.
    *   **Week 3 (Jun 15-21)**: 2 exercise sessions (1 brisk walk + 1 5 km run). Exercise volume **significantly rebounded MoW**. Reasons: business trip ended, family matters prompted greater health focus, compensated with brisk walking.
    *   **Week 4 (Jun 22-28)**: 2 exercise sessions (1 5 km run + 1 long walk). Exercise performance peaked this month, completing 5 km run more easily, and single-day walking volume reached monthly high.
*   **Training Cycle Peaks/Valleys**:
    *   **Peak Week**: Week 4. Best exercise performance (easily completed 5 km run), exercise integrated with leisure (anniversary walk), high physical/mental well-being.
    *   **Valley Week**: Week 2. Exercise plan completely interrupted due to objective reasons (business trip), a key challenge during habit formation.
*   **Exercise Performance Changes**: Running distance steadily increased from 3 km to 5 km, with reduced subjective fatigue post-run, indicating **progressive weekly improvement in cardio endurance and muscular adaptation**. This progress is related to the weekly 1-2 session training frequency and good recovery (sleep, nutrition).

**3.2 Health Trends**
*   **Sleep Trend**: Weeks 1 & 2 had shorter sleep duration (~6.5 hours) and average quality due to studying/business trip; Weeks 3 & 4 saw **progressive weekly improvement** in sleep duration and quality (especially deep sleep perception) as exercise habit solidified and family matters were settled, with weekend compensatory sleep being effective.
*   **Physical Health Trends**:
    *   Weight showed a "**declining amidst fluctuations**" trend: Stable Week 1, temporary increase Week 2 due to business trip eating out (50.3kg), decreased Week 3, steadily declined to 49.5kg Week 4 with exercise and regular diet.
    *   Body fat percentage trend largely synchronized with weight. Resting heart rate (estimate) showed a slow declining trend after regular exercise.
*   **Mental Health Trends**:
    *   Stress levels showed two minor peaks: late Week 2 (post-trip return to work, customer complaint) and early Week 4 (charity sale prep, multitasking).
    *   Emotional highs strongly correlated with family events (daughter's graduation, parents' move, anniversary) and achievement events (successful charity sale). Data shows **emotional scores were generally higher on days following exercise**.
*   **Injury Impact**: No major injury events this month.

**3.3 Life Rhythm Trends**
*   **Sleep Schedule & Mental State**: Data shows that **on days following bedtime past 23:30, self-described mental state was often "slightly fatigued," with potentially reduced patience and energy reserves for complex tasks (e.g., customer complaints)**. Conversely, days following regular early sleep/rise had higher morning run execution rates and work efficiency.
*   **Work/Life Rhythm Changes**:
    *   Work rhythm was tense in Week 2 due to business trip, crowding out exercise.
    *   Life rhythm in Weeks 3-4 presented a "peak in family affairs" due to the concentration of major events (parents' long-term stay decision, daughter's graduation, anniversary, charity sale). However, you managed this effectively through advance planning (e.g., sending daughter to Quanzhou, batch baking), and although busy, a sense of achievement offset some stress.

**Module 4: Personalized Insights**
*   **Sleep ↔ Exercise Performance**: Data shows that when you **slept late the previous night (>23:30), willingness and actual completion rate of the next morning's run plan significantly decreased** (e.g., no morning runs after June 6th, 17th). Conversely, **on days completing a morning run, falling asleep that night was easier, with positive subjective evaluation of sleep quality**, forming a positive feedback loop.
*   **Business Trip/Stress ↔ Health**: **The impact pattern of your short business trip (June 9-11) was: exercise interruption → increased difficulty in dietary control → temporary weight gain of 0.5kg → rapid recovery post-return through adjustment**. Work stress events (e.g., June 12th customer complaint) triggered emotional eating tendencies, causing slight same-day weight gain, but you quickly alleviated stress through proactive problem-solving and social support.
*   **Exercise Type ↔ Physical State**: For you, **low-to-moderate intensity aerobic jogging (within 5 km) is the "sweet spot" exercise for boosting mood, improving sleep, without causing excessive fatigue**. **Long-distance walking (e.g., 12,000 steps on June 28th) achieved considerable exercise expenditure while being leisurely and providing high pleasure**, making it a sustainable exercise mode.
*   **Behavioral Habits ↔ Overall Health**: **The combination of "morning run + friend socialization" had a 100% success rate for your habit adherence**, with social commitment greatly enhancing the stickiness of the exercise behavior. **Applying personal skills (baking) to serve the community (church charity sale) brought you unexpectedly high levels of achievement and mental health benefits**, which may be a more powerful health driver than mere weight numbers. Data shows that **when screen time is used for active learning (clothing, marketing, baking), even if it leads to later sleep, the resulting anxiety is lower than from passive entertainment.**

**Module 5: Anomaly Event Summary**
*   **Exercise Break Events**:
    *   **Time**: June 9th - 11th (3 days total).
    *   **Cause**: Attending Summer Order Fair in Guangzhou, tight work schedule.

    *   **Event**: Temporary weight increase.
    *   **Time & Magnitude**: June 10th, weight reached monthly peak of 50.3kg, an increase of 0.4kg from the previous day.
    *   **Cause**: Eating out during business trip increased difficulty of dietary control, likely exceeding calorie intake.

*   **Life Rhythm Anomaly Events**:

        *   **Recovery Measures**: Did not schedule high-intensity work the next day, adjusted through daily activities, sleep duration returned to normal within the next two days.
    *   **Event 2: Emotional Eating**
        *   **Time**: Evening of June 12th.
        *   **Cause**: Psychological stress release after handling customer complaint.
