### **Module 3: Monthly Trend Analysis**

#### **3.1 Exercise Trends**
*   **Weekly Exercise Volume Changes:**
    *   **Week 1 (Jan 1-7):** Low exercise volume, only 2 walking sessions, total 90 minutes. Period of health awareness awakening and plan formulation.
    *   **Week 2 (Jan 8-14):** Exercise volume **increased significantly by 200%**, initiated morning brisk walk plan, completed 3 specialized training sessions (including 1 indoor alternative), total 100 minutes. Motivation stemmed from post-checkup alertness.
    *   **Week 3 (Jan 15-21):** Exercise volume **remained stable**, completed 3 specialized brisk walks, total 105 minutes. Habit consolidation period, with 1 gap day due to late-night work.
    *   **Week 4 (Jan 22-31):** Exercise volume **stable initially then declined**. Completed 2 brisk walks before holiday (including 1 indoor alternative), persisted with 2 park brisk walks during holiday (28-31) but with slightly reduced duration. Weekly total 125 minutes. Influenced by holiday life rhythm.
*   **Training Cycle Peaks/Valleys:**
    *   **Peak Week:** Week 3, exercise habit most solidified, body and mind adapted to brisk walking intensity, mental state score highest.
    *   **Valley Days:** Week 1 and end of Week 4 holiday, exercise not systematically conducted or intensity reduced, directly related to shift in life focus.
*   **Exercise Performance Changes:** Brisk walking performance improved with persistence. From "initially felt somewhat strenuous" on Jan 12 to "completed 35 minutes against the wind... felt refreshed" on Jan 23, indicating improvements in cardiorespiratory endurance and psychological tolerance.

#### **3.2 Health Trends**
*   **Sleep Trends:** Sleep duration showed a "V" shaped change. Slightly shortened in Week 2 (approx. 6.9 hours) due to starting exercise and work inventory. Rebounded in Week 3 (approx. 7.3 hours) after habit formation. Longest in Week 4 holiday (approx. 7.8 hours) but with poor regularity.
*   **Physiological Health Trends:** Weight and body fat percentage remained **extremely stable** in the first three weeks (fluctuation <0.5 kg), related to regular exercise and dietary control. **Trend mutation in Week 4**: weight increased by 0.8 kg over 4 days due to consecutive family gatherings, the most significant physiological metric change this month. Resting heart rate and HRV trends were opposite; during regular exercise periods, resting heart rate decreased and HRV increased, indicating improved autonomic nervous system balance.
*   **Mental Health Trends:** Stress values showed **event-driven fluctuations**. Reached first minor peak at end of Week 1 due to parental health event; climbed again mid-Week 3 due to work matters; lowest during Spring Festival holiday. Emotional state closely followed family interaction quality; effective communication with parents and improved marital relationship brought positive emotional peaks.
*   **Injury Impact:** Experienced **mild plantar fascia discomfort** after brisk walk on Jan 23, leading to adjustment of next day's exercise to light walking. Discomfort alleviated after 2 days rest (Jan 25), did not significantly impact monthly exercise plan, but highlighted need to pay attention to exercise posture and recovery.

#### **3.3 Life Rhythm Trends**
*   **Sleep Schedule & Mental State:** Data shows that when your **bedtime was before 23:00**, next-day mental state was noticeably more energetic, with 100% exercise plan execution rate; when **bedtime was after 23:30**, next-day fatigue increased, leading to 3 instances of exercise plan cancellation or adjustment.
*   **Work/Life Rhythm Changes:** Weeks 1-3 followed a **work-oriented rhythm**, centered on inventory, planning, learning. Week 4 switched to a **family/social rhythm**, returning home for reunion. The impact of rhythm change on exercise was adjustment of location and time; impact on health was increased dietary intake and greater sleep schedule flexibility.

### **Module 4: Personalized Insights**

*   **Sleep ↔ Exercise Performance:** Your data indicates that **persisting with morning exercise has a positive guiding effect on nighttime sleep that same day**. On days following morning brisk walks, your proactive early bedtime (<23:00) rate was as high as 60%, compared to only 30% on non-exercise days. Data shows one successful morning exercise session doubled your willingness to go to bed earlier that night.
*   **Family Stress/Gatherings ↔ Health:** This month clearly demonstrated the **dual impact of emotional牵挂 and festive atmosphere on health management**. Worry about parents' health (Jan 5-6) led to emotional eating (weight +0.3 kg) and delayed sleep. The happiness of Spring Festival reunion brought relaxation, but also accompanied relaxation of dietary control (weight +0.8 kg over 4 days). This suggests you need to develop specific psychological adjustment and dietary plans for "emotional high-pressure periods" and "holiday scenarios".
*   **Exercise Type ↔ Physical State:** **Regular morning brisk walking was the foundational behavior for your health improvement this month**. Data shows that during periods of坚持 brisk walking (≥2 times/week), your self-reported frequency of "feeling energetic all day" significantly increased, and weekly average resting heart rate decreased by approx. 4 bpm. Additionally, **Yoga/Stretching as a supplement** played a key role in rainy day alternatives and relieving shoulder/neck soreness, representing a good start for a multi-dimensional exercise habit.
*   **Behavioral Habits ↔ Overall Health:** **The core impact of sleep schedule fluctuation lies in its "chain reaction" on exercise plans**. Among the 11 late-night days this month, 5 directly led to cancellation or downgrading of next morning's exercise. Conversely, **prioritizing exercise in the morning** successfully ensured an 80% plan execution rate. Meanwhile, **shifting screen time towards learning** (fashion, baking courses) brought a sense of fulfillment, but prolonged evening study (>1.5 hours) was strongly correlated with late sleep, indicating a need to manage study duration.
