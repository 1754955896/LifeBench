    *   **Week 1 (1st-7th)**: 4 sessions (3 brisk walking, 1 walk), 215 minutes. Good start, establishing morning walking rhythm.
    *   **Week 2 (8th-14th)**: 3 sessions (2 brisk walking, 1 walk), 125 minutes. Activity volume decreased 42% month-over-month, mainly affected by ankle sprain on the 8th, entering recovery adjustment period.
    *   **Week 3 (15th-21st)**: 4 sessions (3 brisk walking, 1 indoor stretching), 160 minutes. Activity volume increased 28% month-over-month, ankle gradually recovering, exercise intensity and duration cautiously increased.
    *   **Week 4 (22nd-30th)**: 11 sessions (7 brisk walking, 3 walks, 1 yoga), 280 minutes. Activity volume significantly increased 75% month-over-month, reaching monthly peak. Foot injury healed, exercise confidence restored, and new exercise forms attempted.
*   **Training Cycle Peaks/Lows**:
    *   **Peak Week**: Week 4, both exercise frequency and duration reached peak, and new parent-child yoga added, highest exercise enthusiasm and diversity.
    *   **Low Week**: Week 2, due to sudden ankle sprain, exercise sessions and duration were the lowest for the month.
*   **Exercise Performance Changes**: Brisk walking average heart rate showed a trend of "increase - interruption due to injury - gradual decrease after recovery." From approx. 140 bpm in weeks 1-2, decreasing to 130-132 bpm by week 4, indicating possible improvement in cardiorespiratory efficiency with resumed regular training.

**3.2 Health Trends**
*   **Sleep Trends**: Sleep duration showed cyclical fluctuations, generally better on weekends than weekdays. Week 2 (8th-14th) had 3 days with bedtime later than 23:30 due to foot injury discomfort, overtime work, and study pressure, possibly affecting sleep quality. Week 4, although busy, had relatively stable sleep quality due to strong sense of achievement and positive emotions.
*   **Physical Health Trends**: Weight fluctuated between 49.8kg and 50.9kg, overall trend stable with slight decrease. Week 3 showed a small peak (50.8-50.9kg), related to family gathering on the 15th and Easter dinner on the 20th, followed by weight returning through resumed exercise and dietary attention the next week.
*   **Mental Health Trends**: Stress levels and mood showed clear "event-driven" fluctuations. Weeks 2-3 had higher stress levels and emotions mixed with "frustration" and "worry" due to multiple matters like injury, parents' health, work, and study. Week 4 saw stress relief and emotions dominated by "joy," "pride," and "satisfaction" as matters were resolved one by one and the community class succeeded.
*   **Injury Impact**: Left ankle sprain on April 8th directly affected the week 2 exercise plan, causing a 4-day exercise break, and requiring adjusted exercise intensity (slower pace) at the beginning of week 3. Returned to normal exercise routine around April 18th.

**3.3 Life Rhythm Trends**
*   **Sleep Schedule & Mental State**: Data shows that on days following bedtime later than 23:30 (e.g., 3rd, 14th), the frequency of keywords like "fatigue" in the day's description increased, and exercise willingness or efficiency may have decreased (e.g., canceled morning walk on 8th, 22nd).
*   **Work/Life Rhythm Changes**: Week 3 had high work/study intensity (parents' open day, parents' check-up, tax research), squeezing some personal relaxation time, leading to temporary stress accumulation. Week 4 life rhythm leaned more towards social and community activities (summit, gathering with close friends, community class), with strong mental fulfillment, effectively countering work pressure.

**Personalized Insights**

*   **Sleep ↔ Exercise Performance**: Data shows that when you maintained the morning brisk walking habit (e.g., week 4), daytime mental state tended more towards "energetic" and "positive," helping cope with busy store management and family affairs. Conversely, when exercise was interrupted (e.g., week 2), mentions of daytime "fatigue" increased.
*   **Family Interaction/Stress ↔ Health**: Deep family interactions (e.g., picnic on 6th, parent-child yoga on 25th, visiting relatives on 27th) had a significant positive impact on your emotional health, with mood tags like "warm," "satisfied," "joyful" appearing at a 100% rate on those days. Concerns related to parents' health (17th) directly led to increased stress and emotional tension, highlighting the important impact of family responsibility on your mental health.
*   **Exercise Type ↔ Physical State**: Regular morning brisk walking (≥3 times/week, ≥30 minutes/session) is the cornerstone for maintaining your stable weight (monthly fluctuation <1kg) and daytime energy. The newly introduced family parent-child yoga is not just an exercise but also viewed by you as "a high-quality parent-child interaction and emotional relaxation method," achieving dual empowerment for both exercise and family relationships.
*   **Behavioral Habits ↔ Overall Health**: Extending health focus from personal to family (e.g., researching healthy recipes for parents, establishing a family health fund) significantly enhanced your sense of "responsibility" and "contentment," constituting an important internal driver for your improved mental health score this month. Simultaneously, the "sense of achievement" and "community connection" brought by successfully leading the community public welfare class (28th) were key socio-psychological factors in boosting your overall life satisfaction at month-end.
