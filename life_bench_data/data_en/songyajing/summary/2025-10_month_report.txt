#### **2.2 Health Review**
*   **Sleep:**
    *   Average Daily Sleep Duration: Workdays ~**6.8 hours**, Weekends ~**7.5 hours**. Weekend catch-up sleep is evident.
    *   Sleep Stage Distribution (Inferred): Deep sleep ~**20-22%** (benefiting from foot soaks and yoga), Light sleep ~55-60%, REM ~20-25%.
    *   Sleep Schedule Stability: Bedtime fluctuated significantly, ranging between **22:00-00:10**; Wake-up time relatively stable, ranging **5:45-8:00** (later on weekends). Average daily sleep interruptions ~1-2 times.
*   **Physiological Metrics:**
    *   **Weight:** Start of month 48.0kg, end of month 47.8kg, overall decrease of 0.2kg. Weekly averages: Week 1 48.2kg, Week 2 48.3kg, Week 3 48.1kg, Week 4 47.9kg. Largest fluctuation on Oct 6 (48.5kg, due to holiday feast), overall trend shows fluctuation with a decrease.
    *   **Body Fat Percentage (Estimated):** Based on regular exercise and weight loss, estimated start of month ~**25.5%**, end of month ~**25.0%**, decrease ~0.5%, muscle mass likely maintained or slightly increased due to running.
    *   **Resting Heart Rate (Inferred):** Daily average **65-70 bpm**. With improved aerobic capacity, may have decreased by **3-5 bpm** from month start to end. Highest values likely on high-work-stress days (e.g., 7th, 22nd).
    *   **HRV (Heart Rate Variability, Inferred):** Daily average at moderate level. **Lowest values** likely during high-work-pressure periods (e.g., 7th-8th paying rent, operational planning); **Highest values** occurred post-retreat and after achieving exercise goals (e.g., 19th, 23rd), indicating effective stress relief and recovery.
*   **Mental Health:**
    *   **Stress:** Daily average stress level ~**5/10**. Notable fluctuations: High-stress periods were **Oct 7-8, 22nd, 29-30th**, stress sources respectively "store lease renewal & planning," "mini-program launch decision," "pre-launch technical coordination & anxiety," stress levels up to 7/10. Low-stress periods during retreat and post-sharing event, stress levels down to 2-3/10.
    *   **Mood:** Predominant mood tags were **"fulfilled," "anticipatory," "peaceful,"** overall positive. Fluctuation periods: Early month holiday "joyful, satisfied"; Mid-month work period "slightly anxious, tired"; Post-retreat "calm, fulfilled"; Pre-launch end of month "anticipatory, slightly nervous."
    *   **Health Score (Inferred):** Daily average score ~78 points. Highest scores ≥85 points (post-retreat, after completing 5km run); Lowest scores ≤70 points (work-related late nights & high-stress days). Score strongly correlates with exercise completion, stress levels, and sleep quality.

#### **2.3 Life Rhythm Review**
*   **Sleep/Wake Habits:**
    *   Average Daily Bedtime/Wake-up: Workdays bedtime ~23:30, wake-up ~6:30; Weekends bedtime ~23:00, wake-up ~7:30.
    *   Workday vs. Weekend Difference: Weekends **30 minutes later to bed, 60 minutes later to rise** than workdays, total sleep duration ~50 minutes longer.
    *   Disrupted Sleep Schedule Days: **8 days** (bedtime later than 23:30), reasons include: Social gatherings (3rd), work review & planning (7th, 8th), exciting events (10th), decision-making contemplation (14th, 22nd), technical coordination (29th).
*   **Commute/Activity:**
    *   Average Daily Non-Exercise Steps: **~5500 steps** (based on store owner occupation, significant in-store activity). Highest weekly step count likely during National Day Quanzhou trip week (Week 1), lowest during work-intensive, low-exercise Week 4.
    *   Commute Mode: Walking or driving. From home address (Hubin South Road) to store (Zhongshan Road), one-way distance ~**2-3 km**, average daily commute time ~**20-30 minutes**.
    *   Business Trip/Travel: 1 instance, Oct 4th Quanzhou nostalgia trip (day trip). Impact: No structured exercise that day, but high step count; Sleep earlier and of higher quality due to fatigue.
*   **Daily Life:**
    *   Screen Time: Average daily duration ~**6-7 hours** (Work: 4-5 hours, for customer communication, online operations, financial tasks; Entertainment: 2-3 hours). Peak days may exceed 8 hours (e.g., creating promotional materials, technical communication days).
    *   Eating Habits: Three-meal regularity relatively high, ~**25 days regular**, irregularity mainly on holidays (6th) and when out (25th). Dietary structure leans towards **high-carb** (preference for Minnan noodles, pastries), but conscious effort this month to control dessert intake during gatherings (27th). Takeout meals ~8-10 times, home-cooked meals dominant. Average daily water intake ~**1.5L**.

### **Module 3: Monthly Trend Analysis**

#### **3.1 Exercise Trends**
*   **Weekly Exercise Volume Changes:**
    *   Week 1 (1st-6th): 2 exercise sessions (running), initiation phase, included rest and family activities due to holiday.
    *   Week 2 (7th-13th): 5 exercise sessions (running 4 times + badminton 1 time), **150% increase month-over-month**. Reason: Holiday ended, resumed work rhythm, participated in community activity.
    *   Week 3 (14th-20th): 4 exercise sessions (running 3 times + yoga 1 time), 20% decrease month-over-month. Reason: Included retreat weekend (18th-19th no exercise), but exercise quality high (included 5km breakthrough).
    *   Week 4 (21st-31st): 5 exercise sessions (running 4 times + yoga 2 times), **25% increase month-over-month**. Reason: To prepare for November launch, used exercise to maintain energy, persisted with yoga to alleviate sedentary fatigue.
*   **Training Cycle Peaks/Troughs:**
    *   **Peak Week:** Week 4. Performance: Completed first-ever 5km run (23rd), running pace stable, and maintained two yoga sessions. Trigger: Post-retreat peaceful mindset, strong sense of purpose.
    *   **Trough Day/Week:** Latter half of Week 1 (2nd-3rd) and weekend of Week 3 (18th-19th). Manifested as exercise gaps. Triggers: Active recovery, social activities, retreat schedule.
*   **Exercise Performance Changes:**
    *   Running pace improved from ~8'00"/km in Week 1 to ~7'35"/km in Week 4, indicating **significant enhancement in cardiorespiratory endurance**. Pace improvement positively correlates with accumulated training load from consistent 3-4 sessions per week, with recovery runs after rest days (e.g., retreat) showing particularly good form.

#### **3.2 Health Trends**
*   **Sleep Trends:**
    *   Weeks 1 & 2: Sleep duration highly volatile, influenced by holidays and initial work stress, deep sleep continuity average.
    *   Week 3: **Best sleep quality.** During retreat (18th-19th), sleep duration sufficient and quality high, attributed to relaxing environment and psychological release.
    *   Week 4: Sleep duration somewhat compressed, **bedtime delayed.** Reason: Final preparations and communication for mini-program launch led to mental excitement and anxiety. Deep sleep percentage likely partially maintained due to pre-sleep yoga and foot soaks.
*   **Physical Health Trends:**
    *   **Weight & Body Fat Percentage:** Overall **slow decreasing trend.** Slight rebound in Week 2 due to holiday, continued decrease in Weeks 3 & 4 with regular exercise and dietary control. **Data shows weekly weight decrease when weekly running distance exceeded 15km.**
    *   **Resting Heart Rate & HRV:** **The two show an inverse correlation trend.** During high-work-pressure weeks (e.g., Weeks 2, 4), inferred resting heart rate higher, HRV lower; During recovery/retreat week and post-exercise breakthrough (Week 3 weekend, mid-Week 4), resting heart rate lower, HRV higher.
*   **Mental Health Trends:**
    *   Stress levels showed a wavelike pattern of "**high pressure - release - steady - pre-launch anxiety**." Weeks with high exercise frequency (e.g., Weeks 2, 4) provided an outlet for stress; however, major decision points (22nd) and pre-launch eve (30th) still triggered significant anxiety. The retreat (Week 3) brought deep stress release and emotional reset.
*   **Injury Impact:**
    *   Shoulder/neck discomfort, as a persistent sub-health state, was identified after Oct 9th physical exam, and yoga intervention began on the 16th. **Data shows reduced reports of discomfort during weeks with shoulder/neck yoga,** but not fully eliminated, requiring continued intervention.

#### **3.3 Life Rhythm Trends**
*   **Sleep Schedule & Mental State:** Data shows that **on days following bedtime after 23:30, morning runs felt more effortful subjectively, and more coffee was needed during the day for alertness.** For example, after staying up late on Oct 8th, the morning run on the 9th was completed but felt "fatiguing."
*   **Work/Life Rhythm Changes:**
    *   Work intensity significantly increased in **Week 2 (post-holiday planning) and Week 4 (launch sprint)**, directly leading to encroachment on exercise time (1-day gap in Week 2) and delayed sleep (multiple late nights in Week 4).
    *   Life changes like the **retreat (Week 3)** and **return to alma mater for sharing (Week 4 weekend)**, while briefly altering exercise rhythm, had a significantly positive impact on mental health, enhancing overall sense of well-being and value.

### **Module 4: Personalized Insights**

*   **Sleep ↔ Exercise Performance:** Data shows that **when sleep duration ≥7 hours and bedtime is before 23:00, the average pace of the next morning's run can improve by 5-10 seconds/km, and subjective fatigue is reduced.** The inverse correlation also holds: **On days with running distance breakthroughs (e.g., 5km) or higher intensity (pace attempts), the proportion of deep sleep that night may increase**, reflecting the body's repair needs.
*   **Travel/Pressure ↔ Health:** **The retreat, as a special "psychological trip," shows that disengaging from the high-pressure daily environment for 2 days can reduce stress levels by 60% (from 6/10 to 2/10) and significantly elevate the emotional baseline for the following week.** Regular work pressure differs: when self-rated stress levels remain ≥7/10 for 2+ consecutive days, even with maintained exercise, inferred resting heart rate stays elevated, and weight loss trend stalls.
*   **Exercise Type ↔ Physical State:** Comparison reveals that **during weeks with ≥2 yoga sessions (e.g., Week 4), frequency of complaints about shoulder/neck stiffness decreased by over 50%, and falling asleep
