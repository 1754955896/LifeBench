    *   **Performance Peak Week:** Week 3. Best exercise consistency, and successfully hosted a community activity, creating a positive cycle between sense of social value and exercise confidence.
    *   **Performance Valley Day:** May 20th. Impacted by dual stress shocks, exercise interrupted, mental health indicators dropped to the month's lowest point.
*   **Exercise Performance Changes:** Brisk walking pace and duration showed steady improvement, from initial tentative 15 minutes to later stable 30-35 minutes, indicating simultaneous improvement in cardiovascular endurance and habit stability.

#### **3.2 Health Trends**
*   **Sleep Trends:**
    *   Weeks 1-2: Sleep duration and quality relatively good.
    *   Week 3: Began experiencing later bedtimes due to community activity preparation (14th) and family financial worries (19th), sleep duration compressed.
    *   Week 4: Stress events concentrated, increased difficulty falling asleep, greatest fluctuation in sleep quality.
    *   Week 5: Anxiety alleviated through planning and family meetings, sleep gradually returned to stability.
*   **Physical Health Trends:**
    *   **Weight:** Showed a fluctuating curve of "slight holiday increase - exercise decrease - slight stress increase - post-action decrease". Peaked on May 24th due to gathering, then reached the month's lowest value at month-end through dietary control and persistent exercise.
    *   **Resting Heart Rate & HRV (Estimated):** Strongly correlated with stress curve. Estimated increase in resting heart rate and decrease in HRV during high-stress weeks; trend reversed after regular exercise and problem-solving.
*   **Mental Health Trends:**
    *   **Stress & Emotion:** Showed a "U-shaped" change. Relaxed at month start, anxiety climbed mid-month due to multiple real-life issues, significantly alleviated by month-end through proactive learning, planning, and family coordination, emotions returned to stable and positive.
    *   **Exercise Correlation:** Data shows that during periods of consistent brisk walking (e.g., weeks 2, 3), your daytime emotions were more stable and positive; while on exercise break days (e.g., May 10th, 20th), feelings of fatigue and helplessness were more pronounced.
*   **Injury Impact:** Experienced "mild lower back soreness" after community activity on May 15th, leading to next-day brisk walking adjustment (slower pace, shorter duration). Symptoms largely subsided after about 2 days, no long-term impact on exercise habit.

#### **3.3 Life Rhythm Trends**
*   **Sleep Schedule & Mental State:** Data shows that when you slept later than 23:30 (e.g., May 8th, 14th, 18th, 20th), your mental state was noticeably fatigued the next day, willingness to brisk walk decreased, and store work efficiency was also affected.

    *   **Increased Work Intensity from Week 3:** Not only busy with daily store operations but also added community project planning/execution, autumn product selection/purchasing tasks.
    *   **Life Changes:** Received information on husband's career risk and store renovation rumors, constituting the main psychological shocks.
    *   **Impact:** Directly led to increased screen time (for learning, information searching) in weeks 3 & 4, sleep time compressed, emotional anxiety levels increased. However, by transforming this into learning and planning, you ultimately turned the negative impact into motivation to enhance coping ability.

### **Module 4: Personalized Insights**

*   **Sleep ↔ Exercise Performance:** Data shows that when you ensured bedtime before 23:00 and sleep duration ≥7 hours (e.g., May 6-7th, May 29-31st), the willingness and completion rate of next-morning brisk walking reached 100%, and daytime energy was充沛. Conversely, if you stayed up late due to anxiety the previous night (e.g., May 20th), the probability of next-day exercise interruption increased by 80%.
*   **Stress/Uncertainty ↔ Health:** This month, you vividly demonstrated the complete chain of "stress perception - health impact - action response". The dual risk information around May 20th caused a sharp estimated increase in stress levels, triggering insomnia, appetite fluctuations, and exercise interruption. However, the subsequent series of actions you took—"venting with close friends", "taking online courses", "formulating family response plans"—successfully transformed anxiety into a sense of control. By month-end, related health indicators had significantly recovered.
*   **Exercise Type ↔ Physical State:** For you, **regular low-intensity cardio (brisk walking) is a core tool for managing emotions**. Data shows that when maintaining brisk walking ≥5 days/week, your self-reported proportion of "calm" and "fulfilled" emotions increased by 50%. Additionally, **social exercise** (e.g., walking with neighbors) improved exercise adherence and brought an extra sense of community belonging.
*   **Behavioral Habits ↔ Overall Health:** **Morning routine (including brisk walking) is the "anchor point" for your daily state**. During periods adhering to this habit, overall time management was more orderly. **Transforming hobbies (baking) and learning (fashion history) into creative output and professional knowledge** brought you significant achievement and value, an important psychological resource for offsetting anxiety. **In-depth family communication** (e.g., May 28th meeting) had an immediate effect on alleviating shared stress and enhancing security.
