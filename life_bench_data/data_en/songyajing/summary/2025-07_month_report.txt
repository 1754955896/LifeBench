**Monthly Trend Analysis**
*   **Activity Trends**:
    *   **Weekly Activity Volume Changes**: Week 1 (1-7): 2 sessions, exploratory. Week 2 (8-14): Lowest volume due to trip and injury. Week 3 (15-21): Recovery and intensification, peak volume. Week 4 (22-31): Maintained stability, tried new forms like swimming.
    *   **Training Cycle Peaks/Valleys**: Peaks in Weeks 3 & 4, with improved running pace and peak perceived fitness. Valley in Week 2, with near-stagnation due to external events.
    *   **Performance Changes**: Running pace improved from ~9'00"/km early July to ~7'30"/km late month. Heart rate adaptation to same intensity improved. Performance gains directly correlated with habit solidification and physical adaptation.
*   **Health Trends**:
    *   **Sleep Trends**: Week 2 (business trip) had shortest duration, likely lower quality. Week 4, with fewer commitments, had best duration and stability.
    *   **Physical Health Trends**: Weight peaked mid-month due to social meals (July 12, 20), but dropped to low by month-end via regular exercise and dietary adjustment. Resting Heart Rate (inferred) and HRV (inferred) trends positively correlated with activity volume, negatively with stressful events.
    *   **Mental Well-being Trends**: Stress highest in Weeks 2 & 3 (family financial decision period), significantly lower in Week 4 (after plan implementation, successful community sharing). Mood state highly positively correlated with accomplishment events (baking, party, sharing).
    *   **Injury Impact**: Ankle sprain on July 10th led to pausing runs that week and the following 3 days, switching to indoor training, slightly affecting monthly running volume.
*   **Life Rhythm Trends**:
    *   **Sleep & Mental State**: Data shows when bedtime was after 23:30, next-day morning run willingness or performance was affected (e.g., July 8, 17).
    *   **Work/Life Rhythm Changes**: Week 2 business trip disrupted daily rhythm; Week 3 focused on family decisions like insurance, spiking screen time; Week 4 community events introduced new social rhythm. These changes temporarily impacted exercise scheduling and sleep.

**Personalized Insights**
*   **Sleep ↔ Exercise Performance**: Data shows when you ensured sufficient sleep the previous night (e.g., July 18, 22), the next morning's run felt easier with a naturally faster pace. Conversely, if you stayed up late for work (e.g., July 17), the next day either had no exercise planned or felt fatigued.
*   **Business Trip/Stress ↔ Health**: During the July 3-5 business trip, exercise paused, routine changed, weight slightly increased. The July 17-18 car repair event brought financial stress, leading to increased screen time, delayed bedtime, and short-term increased mental load.
*   **Activity Type ↔ Physical State**: Regular morning runs (≥2/week) significantly improved your cardio endurance and daytime energy levels. Indoor training starting July 14th effectively maintained a basic exercise habit during injury. Late-month parent-child yoga promoted family interaction and body flexibility.
*   **Behavioral Habits ↔ Overall Health**: Data shows on days you maintained morning runs and recorded data (e.g., late July), overall mood was more positive with a stronger sense of control over work and life. High frequency of home-cooked meals (~22 days) was a key foundation for achieving the month's net weight loss amidst fluctuations. Screen time, especially evening entertainment use, correlated with delayed bedtime.
