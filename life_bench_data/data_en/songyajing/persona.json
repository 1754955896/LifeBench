Dr. Wang's calm and meticulous demeanor left Song with an impression of professionalism and reliability, leading her to consistently seek his advice for family health matters. As Song is a Catholic and there happens to be a church near Dr. Wang's community center, the two occasionally cross paths at community events. Nowadays, Song and her family (including her children) contact Dr. Wang for minor illnesses, vaccinations, and health consultations. They primarily communicate through WeChat for online consultations, averaging about once per quarter, or schedule clinic appointments when a family member feels unwell. Their meetings usually take place at the community health center, with conversations focusing on diagnosis and health advice, occasionally accompanied by casual exchanges about their recent lives."

They became acquainted during the shop's preparation phase in 2020. He is meticulous and pragmatic, providing professional and attentive service. In addition to handling routine banking transactions, he also offers Song Yajing basic financial advice, such as savings planning and introductions to simple wealth management products. Since Song Yajing's shop is located in Siming District, their workplaces are not far apart. They primarily stay in touch via WeChat and phone calls, connecting about once or twice a month for business matters or holiday greetings. Occasionally, they communicate in person when Song Yajing visits the bank for transactions, but they do not engage in frequent social gatherings privately."
