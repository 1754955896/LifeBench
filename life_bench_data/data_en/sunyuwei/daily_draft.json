Faced with some challenging literary selections and complex grammatical phenomena, she repeatedly read through her textbooks and notes, practicing translations on scratch paper. In the quiet library, only the sounds of turning pages and writing could be heard, creating a solemn atmosphere."

She carefully read through these experience-sharing posts, learning about the basic concept of ASMR (Autonomous Sensory Meridian Response), common trigger sound types (such as whispering, tapping, and role-playing), and the styles of different hosts. This gave her a more rational understanding of this newfound discovery and sparked the idea of trying it out herself."

Before going to bed at night, she spent twenty minutes reviewing the day’s records and discovered that when feelings of \"anxiety\" arose, her craving for sweets noticeably increased—a preliminary yet important observation."

Anxiety/stress is highly correlated with cravings for high-sugar snacks; 2. When dining with family or friends, signals of pleasure and satiety are clearer, and eating feels more natural; 3. During periods of high physical activity, hunger sensations are genuine and distinct. At the end of the diary, she wrote a one-page summary, with the core conclusion being: compared to mechanically following external rules, it is more important to learn to recognize and respect the body's genuine signals and emotional needs in different situations. Instead of establishing new rules, she decided to carry this \"awareness\" into her future life."
