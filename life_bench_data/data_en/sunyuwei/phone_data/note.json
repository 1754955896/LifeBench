The theme, 'The Solitude of Autumn,' guided by the teacher, allowed us to perceive the texture of time within the juxtaposition of withering and flourishing. I attempted to comprehend the imperfections, transience, and depth in the aesthetics of 'wabi-sabi.' A friend's remark, 'a gentle resistance,' struck me as particularly insightful—perhaps it is a silent response to the inevitable fading of autumn. While wrapping moss around withered branches, I recalled reading Japanese ikebana texts that emphasize harmony with nature and the expression of seasons. These fragments await further reflection to be distilled into writing.",

Coach He pointed out that my rounded shoulders and forward head posture are related to long-term poor sitting habits and taught me several targeted exercises: 1. Resistance Band Rows (focus on engaging the back muscles and retracting the shoulder blades); 2. Resistance Band Face Pulls (to alleviate tension in the anterior deltoids); 3. Resistance Band External Rotations (to activate the rotator cuff muscles). There was also a very effective corner stretch. A crucial reminder: never shrug your shoulders while typing!
