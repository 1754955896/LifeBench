There is a lack of regular exercise habits, with no participation in physical activities or attendance at sports events over the past year.

However, as a young person, the individual possesses abundant energy and occasionally practices yoga to relieve stress.",
  "lifestyle_desc": "The lifestyle is quiet and introspective, primarily centered around home and campus activities. Information acquisition heavily relies on the internet, with daily online engagement. The most frequent leisure activities include resting and relaxing, social visits, and studying to recharge. On a monthly basis, they go out to watch movies, gather with friends, and listen to music at home, while weekly activities involve shopping and reading. Although they have a strong appreciation for nature, they have not participated in outdoor leisure activities such as hiking in the past year, creating a contradictory state of \"yearning but not acting.\" Over the past year, they spent 10 to 15 nights away from home due to vacations or visiting relatives and traveled by air twice, indicating intermittent travel needs or a desire for exploration in their life.",
  "economic_desc": "The family's financial situation is relatively favorable, owning two properties but currently without a family car. The family does not engage in any investment activities such as stocks, funds, bonds, futures, warrants, or property speculation, indicating a possibly conservative financial management style. As a student and freelancer, the individual has an annual income of approximately 80,000 yuan, primarily derived from writing. In terms of consumption habits, they go shopping several times a month and are relatively financially independent. However, overall asset and investment allocation details are unclear and may be primarily managed by the family.",
  "work_desc": "Currently a university student, I work part-time as a freelance writer or content creator, typically from home or school. My weekly working hours amount to approximately 20, primarily focused on writing and editing. I have a certain degree of autonomy in scheduling my work, which falls under a flexible work arrangement. As a part-time role, there is no fixed employer, administrative level, or specific ownership structure. Commuting time is virtually negligible. Overall job satisfaction is high, and I derive a sense of value and fulfillment from the creative process.",
  "experience_desc": "Sun Yuwei was born and raised in Kunming City, Yunnan Province, with her household registration registered locally since birth and never relocated. She completed her primary and secondary education step by step in the local area and was admitted to the Chinese Department of a key university in the province in 2018. Currently (2021), she is a junior student, while also engaging in freelance writing during her spare time, contributing articles to some media platforms. Her first formal job is \"student,\" with content creation as a part-time occupation. Her life trajectory has been relatively stable, with her main life and social circles concentrated in Kunming. She has not yet experienced major life changes such as marriage, childbirth, or cross-city relocation and is currently in a stage of exploring her personal career direction and inner world.",
  "description": "Sun Yuwei, 22, is a local of Kunming and a university student as well as a freelance writer. She has a slender figure and a quiet, introverted personality. Her MBTI type is INFP, and she values fulfillment in her spiritual world and personal growth, possessing a compassionate nature. She is currently studying in the Chinese Department of her university while working part-time from home as a content creator, with an annual income of approximately 80,000 yuan. She is unmarried and lives with her family, which owns two properties but no car, and she maintains a conservative approach to financial management. Sun Yuwei leads a relatively slow-paced life, with her main leisure activities being reading, listening to music, journaling, and studying the Ikenobo school of Japanese flower arrangement. She loves traveling but has limited practical experience with outdoor activities, relying entirely on the internet for information. She takes several flights each year for vacations or to visit relatives. Significant milestones in her life include her university enrollment and the publication of her first column. Her short-term goals are to complete the first draft of a collection of essays and embark on cultural travels within the country, while her long-term aspirations include cultivating healthier lifestyle habits. She likely frequents local independent bookstores and cafes for inspiration and maintains deep, though not frequent, connections with a few close friends. Her future vision is to become an influential cultural observer while balancing her academic pursuits and creative work.",

        "relation_description": "Tang Lei was Sun Yuwei's middle school classmate, and they met while attending the same middle school in Kunming City. After graduating from middle school, Tang Lei moved with his family to Guangdong, studied computer science at Shenzhen University, and stayed in Shenzhen to work after graduation. He is outgoing and lively, with quick thinking, which complements Sun Yuwei's introverted and quiet nature. The two now mainly keep in touch via WeChat, communicating once or twice a month on average, with topics mostly revolving around their respective lives, career developments, and occasionally sharing interesting books or online articles. Due to living in different cities, they have not seen each other for several years, but they plan to meet and catch up if Sun Yuwei passes through Guangdong during her domestic cultural travels. In their small middle school class group chat, they occasionally interact as well, and Tang Lei also maintains loose connections with a few other classmates who have pursued careers outside the province."

        "relation_description": "Fang Qing is a friend Sun Yuwei met during a volunteer trip to Dali in 2020. They stayed in the same youth hostel and quickly bonded over their shared love for journaling and independent bookstores. Outgoing and cheerful, Fang Qing is one of the few people in Sun Yuwei’s social circle who can motivate her to participate in outdoor activities. Currently working in Hangzhou, Fang Qing and Sun Yuwei mainly stay in touch through WeChat and Douban, sharing travel tips, book recommendations, and interesting stories from their daily lives, chatting several times a week on average. They have made a pact to plan at least one short domestic trip together each year, with their last meeting taking place six months ago at an independent bookstore market in Chengdu. Despite living in different cities, their shared interests have helped them maintain a close online friendship."
