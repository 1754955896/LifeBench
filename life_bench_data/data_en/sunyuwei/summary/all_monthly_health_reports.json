Trend likely inversely correlated with stress changes, lower during exam week, recovering somewhat during winter break and Spring Festival holiday.\n*   **Mental Health**:\n    *   **Stress**: Estimated average daily stress level: Medium-High (6/10). High-stress periods: January 5-9 (final exam preparation, stress level 8/10) and January 28th (family topic, stress level 7/10).\n    *   **Mood**: Predominant mood tags: \"Calm\", \"Fulfilled\", \"Anxious\", \"Astonished\". Mood fluctuation periods: Exam week (anxious) → Early winter break (relaxed, expectant) → After discovering diary (astonished, inspired) → New Year's Eve (complex, confused).\n    *   **Health Score**: No data.\n\n**2.3 Life Rhythm Review**\n*   **Sleep/Wake Habits**:\n    *   Average Daily Bedtime: Approximately 23:50. Average Daily Wake-up Time: Approximately 08:45.\n    *   Weekday vs. Weekend Difference: Weekends averaged 30 minutes later bedtime, 60 minutes later wake-up, total sleep duration approximately 1 hour more.\n    *   Days with Disrupted Sleep Schedule: 12 days total (bedtime later than 24:00), reasons included late-night studying for finals (5 days), social gatherings (3 days), inspiration (4 days).\n*   **Commute/Activity**:\n    *   Average Daily Non-Exercise Steps: Approximately 4000 steps (estimated). Highest step week: Week 3 (winter break outings, visits). Lowest: Week 2 (exam study).\n    *   Commute Mode: Primarily walking, short single-trip distance (<1km), average daily commute time almost zero (studying/working from home).\n    *   Business Trips/Travel: None this month.\n*   **Daily Life**:\n    *   **Screen Time**: Average approximately 8 hours daily (work/study: 5 hours; entertainment/social: 3 hours). Highest single day exceeded 10 hours (January 20th, online workshop).\n    *   **Dietary Habits**:\n        *   Meal Regularity: Approximately 22 days regular, 9 days irregular (mainly due to skipping meals while studying or late-night snacking).\n        *   Diet Structure: Carbohydrate-heavy, protein intake initially insufficient. Began consciously increasing protein and trying \"meatless days\" towards month-end.\n        *   Takeout Meals: Approximately 8 times. Home-cooked Meals: Approximately 23 times.\n        *   Average Daily Water Intake: Approximately 1.5L (preference for brown sugar pearl milk tea, sugar-sweetened beverage intake requires attention).\n\n**Monthly Trend Analysis**\n\n**3.1 Exercise Trends**\n*   **Weekly Exercise Volume Changes**:\n    *   **Week 1**: Moderate exercise volume (4 sessions, primarily yoga and casual walking), in holiday adjustment period.\n    *   **Week 2**: Exercise volume low point (only 3 sessions, 1 yoga + 2 necessary walks), decreased 25% month-over-month, main reason being final exams occupying significant time and energy.\n    *   **Week 3**: Exercise volume significantly rebounded (15 sessions), surged 400% month-over-month, winter break began, regular yoga resumed, and daily activities like outings and walks increased.\n    *   **Week 4**: Exercise volume remained high (18 sessions), but included Spring Festival family light housework (e.g., deep cleaning), regular yoga paused once due to holiday.\n*   **Training Cycle Peaks/Lows**:\n    *   **Peak Week**: Week 3. Highest exercise frequency, autonomous life rhythm, good exercise adherence.\n    *   **Low Week**: Week 2. Affected by academic high pressure, exercise nearly halted.\n*   **Exercise Performance Changes**: Yoga adherence and physical adaptation improved with increasing weeks of practice (e.g., from \"body stiffness\" to \"posture recognized by coach\"). Walking, as a supplementary activity, volume directly correlated with life arrangements.\n\n**3.2 Health Trends**\n*   **Sleep Trends**: Sleep duration and quality showed a \"V\" shaped change. Week 2 (exam week) had the shortest duration and poorest quality (late-night studying). Duration recovered in Weeks 3 & 4, but bedtime remained unstable due to creative excitement and Spring Festival gatherings.\n*   **Physical Health Trends**:\n    *   **Weight**: Clearly showed a curve of \"decline during stress/consumption period, recovery during recuperation period\". Dropped to monthly low (43.5kg) in Week 2 due to high pressure and irregular diet, steadily recovered from Week 3 onward as pressure eased and nutritional awareness increased, reaching 44.8kg by month-end.\n    *   **Resting Heart Rate & HRV (estimated)**: Trend opposite to stress cycle, likely worsened during exam week, recovered during holiday.\n*   **Mental Health Trends**: Stress levels and emotional state closely followed life event fluctuations. Academic stress (Week 2) → relief and anticipation (early Week 3) → creative inspiration impact (late Week 3) → family topic contemplation (late Week 4).\n*   **Injury/Illness Impact**: Mild cold symptoms appeared on January 19th, possibly due to fatigue from previous days (workshop, late nights). Through early rest (asleep by 22:00 on Jan 19th), symptoms alleviated within 2-3 days, with no significant impact on subsequent exercise.\n\n**3.3 Life Rhythm Trends**\n*   **Sleep Schedule & Mental State**: Data shows that whenever bedtime was later than 24:00 (12 days total), the subjective description of next-day mental state was mostly \"fatigued\", \"drowsy\", and the efficiency or willingness for high-intensity mental activities (e.g., deep writing, studying) that day decreased.\n*   **Work/Life Rhythm Changes**:\n    *   **Work Intensity Changes**: Week 2 was the academic high-pressure period (intense studying, exams), leading to exercise breaks and irregular diet/sleep. Weeks 3 & 4 shifted to creation and self-planning period, rhythm relatively controllable, but self-driven pressure remained.\n    *   **Impact of Life Changes**: Discovering father's diary on January 26th greatly ignited creative passion but also brought psychological pressure of \"how to write it well\", affecting sleep and thoughts in the following days. The family topic on January 28th triggered deep contemplation on personal identity and family relationships, forming the main psychological load at month-end.\n\n**Personalized Insights**\n\n*   **Sleep ↔ Exercise Performance**: Your data shows that on days following sufficient basic sleep duration (>7.5 hours) and earlier bedtime (<23:30), your willingness and quality in adhering to yoga class or creative work were higher. Conversely, after staying up late (>00:30), you were more prone to fatigue and difficulty concentrating during yoga practice the next day.\n*   **Stress ↔ Health**: This month's data clearly reveals the chain effect of academic stress on your health: **\"Final exam week (high stress) → reduced sleep & irregular diet → short-term weight loss of 0.5kg\"**. Simultaneously, excitement-type stress from creative work (e.g., after discovering the diary), while not affecting appetite, led to delayed sleep onset, impacting sleep cycles.\n*   **Exercise Type ↔ Physical State**: **Regular yoga twice a week** had positive physical and mental effects on you: 1) Physically, the coach observed and affirmed your \"improved posture, core strength progress\"; 2) Psychologically, it served as an effective buffer against neck/shoulder stiffness during finals and emotional fluctuations after New Year's Eve. **Walking** was your important low-intensity activity connecting life scenarios (bookstores, hospital, parks), contributing to the main non-exercise energy expenditure.\n*   **Behavioral Habits ↔ Overall Health**: 1) **Regularity**: Adhering to fixed-time yoga classes was the most successful health management behavior this month, bringing positive physical feedback and social support (deepened relationship with coach He Lu). 2) **Consciousness Shift**: The physical exam report on January 12th and the in-depth interview with father on January 14th were two key nodes, moving your health management and core creative work from \"vague feeling\" towards \"data and story-driven\", greatly enhancing the determination and direction of your subsequent actions. 3) **Screen Time**: During participation in the online writing workshop (January 20-22), average daily screen time exceeded 10 hours, directly leading to late sleep that night and fatigue the next day, indicating that high-intensity online learning requires stricter eye and sleep schedule management.\n\n**Abnormal Event Summary**\n\n*   **Exercise Break Event**:\n    *   **Event**: Exercise break due to final exams.\n    *   **Time**: January 5th to 8th, lasting 4 days.\n    *   **Impact**: Yoga paused for 1 session, walking maintained only for necessary commute. Accompanied by concurrent weight loss and insufficient sleep.\n    *   **Recovery**: Walking resumed immediately after exams ended on January 9th, normal life rhythm returned on January 10th, exercise volume fully rebounded in Week 3.\n*   **Health Metric Fluctuation Event**:\n    *   **Event**: Short-term weight loss.\n    *   **Time**: January 5th to 7th.\n    *   **Magnitude**: Decreased from 44.0kg to 43.6kg over 3 days, total reduction of 0.4kg.\n    *   **Cause**: Combined effect of high-intensity mental labor (studying), high psychological stress, and irregular diet (skipping lunch).\n    *   **Follow-up**: After stressor was removed, weight gradually recovered and exceeded starting level through regular winter break schedule and nutritional focus.\n*   **Life Rhythm Anomaly Events**:\n    *   **Event**: Late nights and disrupted sleep schedule during final exam study week.\n    *   **Time**: January 5th to 9th.\n    *   **Impact**: Consecutive days of bedtime past 00:30, average daily sleep less than 7 hours, directly affecting daytime energy and exercise arrangements.\n    *   **Recovery Measures & Effect**: After exams ended, sleep duration quickly recovered through natural holiday relaxation and schedule planning, but bedtime remained influenced by various social and creative activities.\n    *   **Event**: New Year's Eve family discussion on future topics.\n    *   **Time**: Evening of January 28th.\n    *   **Impact**: Triggered unexpected internal turmoil and pressure within the reunion atmosphere, leading to chaotic thoughts and delayed sleep that night.\n    *   **Recovery Measures & Effect**: Gained emotional support by confiding in elder sister, and partially alleviated anxiety through frank communication with parents the next day. Gradually processed this topic over subsequent days through family activities and friend gatherings.",

Days maintaining bedtime before 23:30 often resulted in next-day \"clear thinking,\" \"strong sense of purpose.\"\n    *   **Work/Life Rhythm Changes**: Weeks 1 & 2 were high-intensity planning and initiation phases, long screen time, exercise served as a break; Week 3 focused on Spring Festival family life, rich socializing, exercise integrated into leisure; Week 4 returned to main track of academics and creative work, exercise and health management became fixed parts of the schedule. You successfully embedded health practices into different life rhythms.\n\n**Personalized Insights**\n*   **Sleep ↔ Exercise Performance**: Data indicates that after your **afternoon yoga classes**, sleep anxiety decreased that night and falling asleep was easier. Conversely, **the day after staying up late (>00:30)**, your willingness and performance in any exercise were diminished. This suggests regular exercise promotes sleep, while sleep deprivation directly impairs exercise motivation.\n*   **Stress/Anxious Thoughts ↔ Health**: When you are in **high-pressure work cycles** (e.g., intensive writing, research), the incidence of shoulder/neck discomfort increases, and screen time extends by 1-2 hours, further exacerbating fatigue. However, the **ASMR tool** you discovered, when used on high-pressure evenings, effectively cuts off anxious thoughts, causing resting heart rate (estimated) to tend towards calm within 20 minutes, making it an efficient \"digital meditation\" method suitable for your INFP personality.\n*   **Exercise Type ↔ Physical State**: **Regular yoga twice weekly** provides cumulative benefits for improving your posture and alleviating sedentary anxiety. The greatest value of the **single outdoor brisk walk** was not physical fitness improvement, but successfully breaking the psychological barrier of \"desiring but not acting,\" enhancing your self-efficacy regarding outdoor activities. The two types of exercise respectively fulfill your psychological needs for \"internal repair\" and \"external exploration.\"\n*   **Behavioral Habits ↔ Overall Health**: **\"Project-izing\" health actions** (e.g., setting monthly plans, opening a dedicated \"travel savings\" account) and **\"aestheticizing\"** them (recording in a journal) greatly enhanced your (INFP personality) motivation to persist. Data shows that when you record goals visually (e.g., health plan, savings plan), subsequent execution and completion satisfaction are higher. **Family gatherings** were the main challenge scenario for your dietary control, but you showed good flexible management ability by adjusting with subsequent \"Meatless Days.\"\n\n**Abnormal Event Summary**\n1.  **Injury Event**:\n    *   **Event**: Right shoulder/neck muscle strain.\n    *   **Time**: First appeared Feb 16, persisted until Feb 22.\n    *   **Impact**: Caused pain during yoga practice, requiring pose adjustments; reduced tolerance for desk work; affected vocal relaxation in singing lessons.\n    *   **Recovery**: Through heat application (starting Feb 18), reducing exercise intensity, and increasing rest, basically recovered after Feb 23, with no discomfort by month-end.\n2.  **Exercise Break Event**:\n    *   **Event**: Exercise low period due to a cold and shoulder/neck discomfort.\n    *   **Time**: Feb 19-22, lasting 4 days.\n    *   **Cause**: Lowered immunity leading to a cold, compounded by shoulder/neck strain.\n    *   **Recovery Performance**: Gradually resumed light activity (walks, flower arranging) after Feb 23, fully returned to regular yoga class on the 26th, with no significant apparent fitness decline.\n3.  **Health Indicator Sudden Change Event**:\n    *   **Event**: Short-term weight increase.\n    *   **Time**: Feb 9-12 (around Spring Festival).\n    *   **Magnitude**: From approx. 44.9kg to 45.4kg, increase approx. 0.5kg.\n    *   **Cause**: Frequent family gatherings, increased food intake with structure leaning towards high-oil, high-salt.\n    *   **Follow-up**: After the holiday, through returning to \"Meatless Days\" and regular exercise, weight steadily declined after Feb 20, returning to 45.0kg by month-end.\n4.  **Life Rhythm Anomaly Event**:\n    *   **Event**: Periodic late-night overtime/rush work.\n    *   **Time**: Mainly concentrated on Feb 3, 7, 10, 13, 17, 24.\n    *   **Impact**: Led to low energy the next day, exercise plan cancellation or postponement, extended screen time.\n    *   **Recovery Measures & Effectiveness**: You typically recovered the day after by extending sleep, reducing mental load, and engaging in relaxing activities (e.g., walks, listening to music). Effectiveness was good, with no long-term fatigue accumulation formed.",

No high-intensity (Z3) training this month.\n*   **Activity Statistics & Best Performances**:\n    *   **Brisk Walking**: Total distance ~16km (counting only 4 dedicated brisk walks), average speed ~6km/h. Longest single session 40 minutes (Mar 16, 23, 29, 30), route fixed as the Cuihu Park loop. Best performance on Mar 29, capturing creative inspiration during the walk, achieving a dual harvest of exercise and inspiration.\n    *   **Yoga**: Total duration 240 minutes. Longest single session 60 minutes (weekly class). Focus was on shoulder/neck relaxation and posture maintenance, not pursuing advanced poses.\n    *   **Walking**: As the primary mode of commute and fieldwork, estimated total monthly distance ~30km, constituting the main component of your non-deliberate exercise.\n*   **Activity Habit Preferences**:\n    *   Weekly high-activity day: **Sunday** (fixed brisk walk), followed by Saturday (often scheduled for yoga).\n    *   Daily high-activity time slots: **Morning (8:00-10:00)** primarily for brisk walking; Afternoon (14:00-16:00) sometimes used for walking fieldwork.\n    *   Primary activity locations: **Cuihu Park** (brisk walk 4 times, fieldwork 2 times), **Jingxin Yoga Lifestyle Studio** (yoga 4 times), **City streets** (daily walking and fieldwork).\n    *   Activity Consistency: **Longest consecutive activity streak was 3 days** (e.g., Mar 11-13, including walking fieldwork and yoga). No significant long-term gaps in the month, but there were **2 brief interruptions (each 1-2 days)** due to writing tasks (Mar 26-27) and social arrangements (Mar 20).\n\n**2.2 Health Review**\n*   **Sleep**:\n    *   Average Daily Sleep Duration: **~7.5 hours on weekdays** (e.g., wake 7:30, sleep 23:20), **~8.5 hours on weekends** (e.g., wake 8:45, sleep 23:10).\n    *   Sleep Stage Distribution (Estimate): Based on successful establishment of a pre-sleep reading habit, it is inferred that **deep sleep proportion increased**, with fewer awakenings after sleep onset. Data missing, but subjective report states \"sleep quality acceptable, inner peace improved\".\n    *   Sleep Schedule Stability: **Weekday bedtime varied by ~45 minutes** (22:40-00:25), wake time varied by ~25 minutes (07:20-07:45); **weekend schedule more flexible**, with slightly greater variation. Approximately **8 days** in the month involved bedtime after 23:30 due to socializing, writing, or emotional fluctuations.\n*   **Physiological Metrics**:\n    *   **Weight**: 45.0kg at month-start, 45.2kg at month-end, **net increase of 0.2kg for the month, change magnitude 0.4%**. Weekly averages fluctuated between 45.1-45.6kg, with a maximum single-day fluctuation of +0.5kg (Mar 8, after gathering). Trend was overall stable, indicating dietary adjustments and increased activity did not cause significant fluctuations.\n    *   **Body Fat Percentage**: Data missing. However, considering stable weight and new brisk walking habit, it is inferred body fat percentage remained stable or slightly decreased.\n    *   **Resting Heart Rate**: Data missing. Based on activity types being mostly low-intensity cardio and psychological stress relief by month-end, it is inferred resting heart rate is within a healthy, stable range.\n    *   **HRV (Heart Rate Variability)**: Data missing. Based on your family pressure release at month-end, establishment of a regular bedtime ritual, and exercise habits, **it is inferred HRV showed an overall improving trend**.\n*   **Mental Health**:\n    *   **Stress**: Estimated average daily stress level moderate. **High-stress periods occurred in Week 1 (Mar 3-4, school adaptation) and Week 4 (Mar 26-27, writing sprint and career planning thoughts)**, with stressors primarily being academic/creative deadlines and future uncertainty. After Mar 22, the family stressor was eliminated, reducing overall psychological load.\n    *   **Mood**: Predominant mood labels were **calm, fulfilled, warm**. Positive mood fluctuation periods: Mar 22 (family pressure release), Mar 28 (received sister's travel funding), Mar 29-30 (received father's affirmation, habit solidification). Slight negative mood fluctuations were related to work pressure, wrist discomfort, and pre-menstrual hormonal changes.\n    *   **Health Score (Estimate)**: Daily score average ~72. Lower in Week 1 (school adaptation), steadily improved in Weeks 2-3 (habit establishment), slightly dipped in early Week 4 due to writing pressure, and reached a high point (78) at month-end due to multiple positive events (family, affirmation, goal progress).\n\n**2.3 Life Rhythm Review**\n*   **Sleep Habits**: Weekday average bedtime 23:20, wake 07:30; Weekend average bedtime 23:15, wake 08:45. **Weekend wake time ~75 minutes later than weekdays, total sleep duration ~1 hour longer**. Sleep schedule disruption (bedtime >23:30) occurred on 8 days, reasons including: social gatherings (Mar 8), writing late (Mar 4, 26), emotional excitement (Mar 7), and vocal lessons (Mar 24).\n*   **Commute/Activity**:\n    *   Average Daily Non-Exercise Steps (Estimate): **~5000-7000 steps** (based on student and home-based writer characteristics). Highest step count week was Week 3 (Mar 16-22, including brisk walking, volunteer activity, market shopping). Lowest step count week was the latter half of Week 4 (Mar 26-28, focused writing).\n    *   Commute Mode: Primarily **walking** to/from school (estimated 15-20 minutes one-way) and for city activities, supplemented by public transport.\n    *   Business Travel/Vacation: None this month.\n*   **Daily Life**:\n    *   Screen Time: Average daily duration **~6-8 hours**, primarily for writing, research, online courses, and socializing. Recreational screen time decreased after establishing the reading habit.\n    *   Dietary Habits: **High** regularity of three meals, ~28 days of regular eating. Dietary structure shifted towards **higher plant-based foods**, practicing a \"weekday vegetarian\" pattern. Few takeout meals (~4-5), many homemade meals. Estimated average daily water intake ~1.5L, with room for improvement.\n    *   Key Events: Mar 1 stopped ASMR; Mar 5 mindful eating course began; Mar 22 important family conversation; Mar 28 received sister's travel funding.\n    *   Core Focus Areas: Sleep ritual, weekend brisk walking, mindful eating, mind-body connection journaling.\n\n**Monthly Trend Analysis**\n\n**3.1 Activity Trends**\n*   **Weekly Activity Volume Changes**:\n    *   **Week 1 (Mar 1-7)**: Moderate activity volume, initiated with 2 yoga sessions and daily walking. School adaptation period.\n    *   **Week 2 (Mar 8-14)**: Slight increase in activity volume, added 1 yoga session, active walking fieldwork. More diverse activity types due to Women's Day gathering and flower arrangement workshop.\n    *   **Week 3 (Mar 15-21)**: **Peak activity week**, successfully initiated and executed 2 Cuihu brisk walks (16th, 23rd), and participated in volunteer activity walking. Key week for establishing exercise habits.\n    *   **Week 4 (Mar 22-31)**: Activity volume maintained, completed 2 brisk walks (29th, 30th). However, mid-week (26-28) saw reduced deliberate activity due to focused writing, presenting a \"weekend concentrated compensation\" pattern.\n*   **Training Cycle Peaks/Valleys**:\n    *   **Peak**: Week 3, successfully put brisk walking plan into practice and persisted, showing strongest exercise willingness and execution.\n    *   **Valley**: Mid-Week 4 (26-28), deliberately lowered exercise priority to ensure writing output, representing a mild \"planned valley\".\n*   **Activity Performance Changes**: Brisk walking performance stabilized, transitioning from the initial \"novel and deliberate\" (Mar 16) to later \"composed and anticipated\" (Mar 30), with noticeable improvement in psychological comfort and persistence willingness.\n\n**3.2 Health Trends**\n*   **Sleep Trend**: Sleep in Week 1 was more volatile due to school start; Stability and subjective quality improved in Weeks 2-3 as the bedtime ritual became fixed; Slight fluctuation in early Week 4 due to writing pressure, but quick recovery by month-end. **Data shows that periods with higher adherence to the bedtime ritual (reading+meditation) correlated with higher emotional stability the following day**.\n*   **Physical Health Trend**: Weight showed minor fluctuations of \"slight increase after socializing/dining out, followed by decrease after dietary adjustment\" throughout the month, but the **trend line was extremely stable**. Combined with your subjective description of \"muscles feeling tighter, energy improved\", this suggests positive changes in body composition may be occurring.\n*   **Mental Health Trend**: Stress levels showed two minor peaks in Week 1 (school start) and early Week 4 (writing sprint). Mood entered a clear upward trajectory after the Mar 22 family conversation, reaching a high point at month-end due to multiple affirmations. **Exercise (brisk walking) and high-quality social interaction (family, close friends) were your most effective stress regulators**.\n*   **Injury Impact**: **Mild right wrist strain** occurred Mar 26-27 due to prolonged handwritten note-taking. Impact included reduced handwritten journaling, substituted with voice input. Symptoms alleviated starting Mar 28 through rest and warm compresses.\n\n**3.3 Life Rhythm Trends**\n*   **Sleep & Mental State**: **Data shows that days with bedtime before 23:30 generally correlated with better morning energy state and writing focus the next day**. For example, Mar 19 (slept 23:00) led to efficient writing planning on the 20th; whereas Mar 26 (slept 00:05) was followed by recorded fatigue the next day.\n*   **Work/Life Rhythm Changes**: Weeks 1-2 centered around \"school adaptation\" and \"interest exploration\" (vocal, flower arranging). Weeks 3-4 shifted focus to \"writing攻坚\" and \"career planning\". This rhythm change directly affected the timing of activity scheduling, but you **successfully anchored health habits amidst change by fixing weekend brisk walks**.\n\n**Personalized Insights**\n*   **Sleep ↔ Activity Performance**: Your data shows that **the day after successfully executing the pre-sleep reading ritual, willingness and sustainability for brisk walking or deep writing were higher**. For example, after establishing the bedtime routine on Mar 9, you efficiently handled multiple tasks and actively signed up for new activities the next day (10th). Inverse correlation: After late-night writing (e.g., Mar 26), willingness for deliberate activity decreased the next day.\n*   **Stress/Family Relations ↔ Health**: **The family pressure release on Mar 22 was a key turning point**. Before this, you were engaging in health management but with an underlying burden; afterward, your emotional baseline significantly improved, and adherence to health habits (e.g., brisk walking) shifted more from \"requiring effort\" to \"natural enjoyment\". Data shows that in the week after stress release, even though work intensity didn't decrease, perceived mental fatigue was lower.\n*   **Activity Type ↔ Physical State**: For you, **\"Cuihu Brisk Walking\" is the most effective composite health activity**. It not only fulfills moderate-intensity cardio, but its outdoor, natural environment directly nourishes the spiritual needs of your INFP personality and has repeatedly directly sparked creative inspiration (e.g., Mar 29). **Weeks with 1 brisk walk had higher overall mood and creativity scores than weeks without**.\n*   **Behavioral Habits ↔ Overall Health**: **\"Journaling\" itself is a powerful health management tool for you**. \"Mind-Body Awareness\" journaling via your notebook provided tangible awareness of the connections between diet, sleep, activity, and mood (e.g., discovering the link between afternoon lethargy and lunch greasiness). This transformed your health management from blind attempts to precise adjustments based on personal data.\n\n**Anomaly Event Summary**\n*   **Health Metric Anomaly Event**:\n    *   **Event**: Single-day weight increase of 0.5kg.\n    *   **Time**: March 8.\n    *   **Magnitude**: Increased from 45.4kg on Mar 7 to 45.6kg on Mar 8.\n    *   **Cause**: Women's Day gathering with close friends, dietary intake higher than usual, possibly including high-sodium foods leading to water/sodium retention.\n    *   **Subsequent Change**: Weight returned to the normal range of 45.3-45.5kg within the following 2-3 days by resuming regular diet. This is a normal short-term fluctuation, not affecting the long-term trend.\n*   **Injury Event**:\n    *   **Occurrence Time**: March 26.\n    *   **Injury Type**: Mild right wrist strain (due to excessive handwriting).\n    *   **Impact Scope**: Caused discomfort with handwriting for two consecutive days, affecting note-taking efficiency.\n    *   **Recovery Status**: Symptoms significantly alleviated by Mar 28 through reduced handwriting, switching to voice input, and local warm compresses. Did not affect core activity (brisk walking) or daily life. This event highlights the need to pay attention to work posture and work-rest balance.\n*   **Life Rhythm Anomaly Event**:\n    *   **Anomaly Period**: March 26-27.\n    *   **Anomaly Type**: Due to a writing sprint for graduation thesis and essay collection first draft, led to consecutive two nights staying up until around midnight.\n    *   **Impact on Health/Activity**: Average daily sleep duration reduced to ~6.5 hours, increased daytime fatigue, deliberate activity安排 paused.\n    *   **Recovery Measures & Effect**: After draft completion (Mar 28), immediately resumed regular sleep schedule, and used brisk walking and family activities over the weekend (29-30) for physical and mental recovery. Sleep duration and quality returned",

Eating habits: meal regularity approx. 80% (24 regular days), diet skewed towards high-carb (rice noodles, rice) with attempts to increase vegetarian proportion, takeout approx. 4-5 times, home-cooked meals dominant, estimated average daily water intake 1.5L.\n\n**Monthly Trend Analysis**\n*   **3.1 Exercise Trends**\n    *   **Weekly Activity Changes**: Week 1 (1st-7th): low activity (1 yoga), thesis-focused. Week 2 (8th-14th): began increasing (2 yoga, 1 hike), more exploration post-pressure release. Week 3 (15th-21st): maintained activity (2 yoga, 1 brisk walk), integrated into creative life. Week 4 (22nd-30th): highest activity (2 yoga, 1 brisk walk, 1 hike, 1 regular yoga class), enrolled in regular classes, proactively addressing new stress.\n    *   **Training Cycle Peaks/Valleys**: Exercise performance peak in Week 4, with better subjective feeling during hikes and brisk walks, and enrollment in regular yoga classes indicating exercise willingness and planning reached the month's peak. Valley in Week 1 with lowest frequency.\n    *   **Exercise Performance Changes**: Self-perceived performance in brisk walking (e.g., \"lighter-footed\") improved with more practice. Yoga focus fluctuated in Week 2 (9th) and Week 3 (23rd) due to multitasking and physical discomfort, but recovered in end-of-month regular classes.\n*   **3.2 Health Trends**\n    *   **Sleep Trend**: Week 1: relatively regular sleep. Week 2: compressed sleep time and quality fluctuations due to thesis submission, celebration, and urgent tasks. Week 3: relatively stable recovery. Week 4: later bedtimes due to defense pressure and new planning. Sleep disruptions highly correlated with daytime stressors (e.g., urgent editing) and evening mental activity (e.g., inspiration recording).\n    *   **Physical Health Trend**: Weight changes showed event-driven fluctuations, rising after family gatherings (Weekends 1 & 2), celebration days (mid-Week 2), and falling after high-activity days (Weekends 2 & 4) and during stress-related appetite decrease (end of Week 4).\n    *   **Mental Health Trend**: Stress levels showed a U-shaped curve: high at month's start (thesis pressure), significantly lower mid-month (thesis completion, payment), rising again at month's end (defense notification). Mood positively correlated with creative progress, social support, and exercise frequency, e.g., positive and full mood in Week 3 after smooth writing and deep conversations with close friend and mentor.\n    *   **Injury/Illness Impact**: Spring allergy symptoms on the 23rd led to adjusted yoga intensity that day, with limited impact on overall exercise plan.\n*   **3.3 Life Rhythm Trends**\n    *   **Routine & Mental State**: Data shows that days following bedtime after 24:00 often had descriptions like \"slightly tired\", \"slightly reduced energy\" (e.g., April 8th, 15th, 22nd), affecting exercise performance or creative focus that day.\n    *   **Work/Life Rhythm Changes**: Work intensity peaked in Week 2 with final thesis submission, then dropped sharply. Life rhythm shifted from \"task-driven\" to \"exploration and creation-driven\" starting Week 3, with increased frequency of outings for observation and social gatherings. This shift brought new inspiration but also increased routine irregularity.\n\n**Personalized Insights**\n*   **Sleep ↔ Exercise Performance**: Data shows that when sleep duration was sufficient (≥7.5 hours) and bedtime earlier (e.g., 23:00 on April 2nd), focus and state during next-day yoga (April 2nd) or creative work (April 3rd) were better. Conversely, single days of high-intensity mental work (e.g., urgent editing until 00:45 on April 14th) or exciting evening socializing (e.g., gathering until 00:15 on April 3rd) leading to late sleep often resulted in fatigue the next day.\n*   **Travel/Pressure ↔ Health**: Although no long trips, intensive intra-city exploration and socializing (e.g., multiple outings for exhibitions, visits in Week 3) indirectly compressed sleep and fixed exercise time, delaying the routine. Data shows that when stress increased (e.g., after receiving defense notification), the proactive choice was to enroll in regular yoga classes (April 28th) for active intervention, rather than passive endurance, indicating the budding of good stress coping awareness.\n*   **Exercise Type ↔ Physical State**: Comparison shows \"outdoor walking\" activities (brisk walking, hiking) more readily brought \"mental satisfaction\" and \"inspiration\" (e.g., \"mentally satisfied\" after April 13th hike, anxiety relief after April 17th walk); while \"indoor conditioning\" activities (yoga) were directly linked to \"shoulder/neck relief\" and \"calm mood\" (e.g., \"shoulder/neck stiffness relieved, mood calm\" after April 30th yoga). Weeks maintaining ≥2 yoga sessions showed higher emotional stability.\n*   **Behavioral Habits ↔ Overall Health**: Analysis shows a synergistic effect between \"stable routine\" and \"regular exercise\". After establishing the weekend brisk walking habit, self-awareness of exercise benefits increased (April 26th summary), promoting persistence willingness. When \"screen time\" remained high due to writing and socializing without active relaxation, it easily led to \"delayed sleep onset\" (e.g., staying up late to revise outline on April 22nd).\n\n**Anomaly Event Summary**\n*   **Health Indicator Anomaly Event**:\n    *   **Event**: Onset of spring allergy symptoms.\n    *   **Time**: April 23rd.\n    *   **Impact**: Caused nasal discomfort that day, prompting active reduction of yoga practice intensity, focusing on breathing rather than poses.\n    *   **Recovery**: Not mentioned in subsequent diary entries, presumed mild and resolved, with no long-term impact on subsequent exercise plans.\n*   **Exercise Break Event**:\n    *   **Event**: Exercise plan interrupted by ad-hoc tasks.\n    *   **Time Period**: April 17th-18th (only daily walks, no planned exercise).\n    *   **Break Reason**: 17th: writing block during day, handled insurance matters evening, started essay collection organization at night. 18th: prepared for family gathering and attended online seminar.\n    *   **Post-Break Recovery Performance**: Quickly resumed weekend brisk walk on the 19th with good subjective feeling, no significant impact on exercise capacity.\n*   **Life Rhythm Anomaly Event**:\n    *   **Event**: Multiple late nights due to creative work or socializing.\n    *   **Anomaly Periods**: Concentrated on April 6th (inspiration recording), 14th (urgent editing), 18th (online seminar), 22nd (outline revision), 28th (stress-driven writing).\n    *   **Impact on Health/Exercise**: Led to poor mental state and increased fatigue the next day, and in some cases reduced focus and willingness for daytime exercise or creative work.\n    *   **Recovery Measures & Effect**: Typically recovered via next-day short naps (e.g., April 15th), reduced scheduling, or a relaxing exercise session (e.g., brisk walk on April 19th), but no systematic mechanism for preventing late nights was established.",

Defense week (8th) saw a single-day activity break, but overall volume was maintained.\n    *   Week 3 (15th-21st): Most diverse activity forms (brisk walking, yoga, hiking, moving labor), total activity duration peaked, but minor back strain occurred on the 18th.\n    *   Week 4 (22nd-31st): Graduation ceremony and travel week. Activity consisted mainly of yoga and walking during travel. Brisk walking interrupted due to environmental changes, total activity volume decreased.\n*   **Training Cycle Peaks/Troughs**:\n    *   Peak Week: Week 3, diverse activity types, first hiking attempt, highest physical activity volume.\n    *   Trough Week: Latter half of Week 4 (during travel), regular exercise routine interrupted, activity primarily low-intensity sightseeing walking.\n*   **Performance Changes**: Brisk walking evolved from \"needing to overcome difficulty\" (May 4th) to \"becoming a habit, feeling mentally better\" (May 7th), and finally to \"observing nature, gaining inspiration\" (May 15th), showing a deepening process from physical adaptation to mental benefit.\n\n**3.2 Health Trends**\n*   **Sleep Trends**: Weeks 1-2: Sleep was relatively regular but potentially lower quality due to graduation stress; End of Week 2 (post-defense): Sleep duration may have shortened due to excitement; Week 4 (travel): Changes in bedtime and environment affected sleep continuity.\n*   **Physical Health Trends**: Weight showed an overall downward trend, with brief increases after gatherings (May 9th, 22nd, 24th), dropping to the month's lowest point (44.5kg) at the end of travel (May 31st), correlating with exercise expenditure and life rhythm changes.\n*   **Mental Health Trends**: Stress values peaked early month (family conflict) and mid-month (defense), then gradually alleviated following consistent exercise, social support (friends, advisor), and completion of major events (defense, graduation). Emotional state was best during end-of-month travel.\n*   **Injury Impact**: Minor back strain on May 18th led to increased caution during subsequent days when moving items, and possibly avoidance of related yoga poses, but did not cause long-term activity interruption.\n\n**3.3 Life Rhythm Trends**\n*   **Sleep Schedule & Mental State**: Data shows that on days following sleep after 23:30 (e.g., May 6th, 9th), the frequency of keywords like \"fatigue\" in daily descriptions increased. On days with regular early sleep/wake and brisk walking, mental state was commonly described as \"alert\", \"focused\".\n*   **Work/Life Rhythm Changes**: A series of dense events including defense (May 8th), moving (May 20th), graduation ceremony (May 25th), and end-of-month travel caused significant adjustments and adaptation periods for daily rhythms of activity, sleep, and diet during mid and late month.\n\n**Personalized Insights**\n\n*   **Sleep ↔ Activity Performance**: Data shows that after maintaining morning brisk walking, Sun Yuwei found it \"easier to concentrate\" during daytime writing (May 13th). However, on days following \"late nights\" (after 23:30) due to socializing or creative work, the willingness to perform morning exercise and the recorded \"feeling of refreshment\" decreased.\n*   **Travel/Stress ↔ Health**: During the Dali trip, the regular morning brisk walking habit was interrupted, shifting the activity mode to unplanned sightseeing walking. High-stress events (e.g., argument on May 5th) directly led to \"late sleep\" and \"low mood\" that night, potentially affecting overall energy levels for the next 1-2 days.\n*   **Activity Type ↔ Physical State**: Comparison reveals **Brisk Walking** is primarily associated with \"mental awakening\" and \"gaining creative inspiration\" (multiple records of observation material); **Yoga** is explicitly used for \"alleviating anxiety\" and \"improving shoulder/neck stiffness\" (May 14th, 21st), showing significant effect especially after handling emotional stress events.\n*   **Behavioral Habits ↔ Overall Health**: **Morning Routine Regularity**: When adhering to waking up around 7:00 for brisk walking, daily time management was more orderly and sense of accomplishment stronger. **Dietary Socializing**: Observable temporary weight increases (+0.2 to +0.5kg) occurred after family meals or friend gatherings, warranting attention to the impact of frequent socializing on weight management. **Screen Time**: On days requiring deep writing or planning, screen time significantly increased and was often associated with \"late sleep\".\n\n**Abnormal Event Summary**\n\n*   **Injury Events**:\n    *   Occurrence Time: May 18th.\n    *   Type: Minor back muscle strain.\n    *   Impact Scope: Caused noticeable pain during item organization that day, requiring extra caution during moving in subsequent days, possibly affecting depth in certain yoga poses.\n    *   Recovery Status: Through avoiding heavy lifting and rest, not mentioned again in later event records, indicating basic recovery.\n*   **Activity Break Events**:\n    *   Break Times: May 8th, May 31st.\n    *   Break Reasons: Thesis defense and long-distance travel return respectively.\n    *   Impact & Recovery: These were planned, reasonable breaks, not causing long-term impact on activity habit continuity. Activity resumed the next day or within a couple of days.\n*   **Health Metric Fluctuation Events**:\n    *   Fluctuating Metric: Weight.\n    *   Fluctuation Times: May 9th, May 22nd, May 24th.\n    *   Fluctuation Magnitude: Single-day increase of 0.4-0.6kg.\n    *   Fluctuation Cause: All related to dining out (celebrating defense, birthday dinner, farewell dinner).\n    *   Subsequent Change: Weight returned to pre-increase levels within following days through resuming normal diet and exercise.\n*   **Life Rhythm Anomaly Events**:\n    *   Anomaly Period: May 15th to May 31st (during travel).\n    *   Anomaly Type: Changes in living environment, sleep schedule, and dietary regularity.\n    *   Impact: Morning brisk walking habit interrupted, sleep location and time inconsistent, diet primarily consisted of eating out.\n    *   Recovery Measures & Effect: Returned to Kunming on May 31st, planning to resume regular schedule and exercise in June, expected to quickly return to daily rhythm.",

Lowest estimated score 5.5 (16th), highest estimated score 8.5 (28th), fluctuations strongly correlated with stress events and achievement events.\n\n**2.3 Life Rhythm Review**\n*   **Daily Routine Habits**:\n    *   Average daily bedtime: ~23:25 on weekdays, ~23:15 on weekends.\n    *   Average daily wake-up time: ~7:50 on weekdays, ~8:45 on weekends.\n    *   Weekday vs. Weekend difference: Weekend wake-up ~55 minutes later on average, total sleep duration ~40 minutes more.\n    *   Days with disrupted routine: **8 days** (bedtime later than 23:30), reasons include: last-minute writing (3rd, 27th), socializing (5th, 8th), post-stress event reflection (15th, 26th), excitement (21st, 28th).\n*   **Commute / Activity**:\n    *   Average daily non-exercise steps: ~8500 steps (deducting dedicated exercise steps). Highest step week was Week 4 (intensive photography outings), lowest was Week 3 (reduced activity during laptop crisis).\n    *   Commute methods: Primarily **walking**, with one-way distances to school, bookstore, cafes mostly within 1-2 km, average daily commute/activity walking duration ~40 minutes.\n    *   Business trips/Travel: **None**. However, there were intermittent exploratory outings in daily life (e.g., Dounan Flower Market, Yunnan University old campus for inspiration).\n*   **Daily Life**:\n    *   **Screen Time**: Average daily duration ~**9 hours** (work creation & research ~6 hours, entertainment & social ~3 hours). Highest day exceeded 12 hours (16th-17th, handling crisis, researching equipment), lowest day ~5 hours (14th, mainly family activities).\n    *   **Dietary Habits**: Regular three-meal days ~25 days. Diet structure leans towards **high carbs** (rice noodles, rice), but emphasizes **quality protein and mushrooms**. Takeout meals ~6 times, homemade meals dominant. Estimated average daily water intake ~1.5L, room for improvement.\n    *   **Financial Health**: Two major unplanned expenses occurred this month (computer 8000 RMB, e-reader 2000 RMB), prompting the initiation of systematic financial planning in the latter part of the month, a significant life management event.\n\n**Module 3: Monthly Trend Analysis**\n**3.1 Exercise Trends**\n*   **Weekly Exercise Volume Changes**:\n    *   **Week 1 (1st-7th)**: Exercise volume **moderate**, mainly brisk walking for recovery, yoga, and household chores. Post-holiday adjustment period.\n    *   **Week 2 (8th-14th)**: Exercise volume **relatively high**, added cycling attempt, frequent social walks. Strong exercise motivation due to clear career planning and pleasant mood.\n    *   **Week 3 (15th-21st)**: Exercise volume **lowest this month**. Impacted by laptop crisis, almost no exercise on 15th-17th, gradual recovery of yoga and inspiration walks after the 18th.\n    *   **Week 4 (22nd-30th)**: Exercise volume **recovered with high quality**. High volume of photography inspiration walks, yoga breakthroughs, close integration of exercise and creation.\n*   **Training Cycle Peaks/Valleys**:\n    *   **Peak Week**: **Week 4**. Best exercise performance, mind-body breakthroughs in yoga, photography inspiration walk duration and step count peaked, with strong exercise enjoyment.\n    *   **Valley Week**: **Week 3**. Directly impacted by sudden stressful event, exercise interrupted, subsequent recovery performance also affected by residual emotions.\n*   **Exercise Performance Changes**: Yoga performance showed a **gradual improvement** trend, with clear progress in body control felt by month end. Brisk walking and walking as foundational activities, their duration and frequency directly correlated with life rhythm and mood, sharply decreasing in stress weeks and increasing in fulfilling weeks.\n\n**3.2 Health Trends**\n*   **Sleep Trend**: Weeks 1 & 2 relatively stable sleep; Week 3 (crisis week) **duration shortened, quality declined**, estimated deep sleep percentage decreased; Week 4 gradually recovered, especially sleep quality improved in the last few days due to improved mindset.\n*   **Physical Health Trends**:\n    *   **Weight/Body Fat**: Weeks 1 & 2 stable with slight decrease; Week 3 **significant rebound** due to stress; Week 4 resumed downward trend through adjustment. **Stress is a key disruptive factor for weight fluctuations**.\n    *   **RHR/HRV**: Trends completely synchronized with stress events. Week 3 RHR increased, HRV decreased; Week 4, especially after receiving positive feedback, both metrics improved to the month's best levels.\n*   **Mental Health Trends**: Stress levels showed a **\"double valley, single peak\"** pattern. Calm at month start, peaked mid-month (Week 3), dropped to a low at month end due to problem resolution and recognition. Mood closely followed stress changes, but the sense of achievement and confidence boost at month end surpassed mere stress relief, bringing a more positive emotional state.\n*   **Injury Impact**: No physical injuries this month. However, the **psychological stress event (laptop damage)** produced a chain effect similar to an \"injury\" on exercise, sleep, and physiological metrics, lasting about 3-4 days.\n\n**3.3 Life Rhythm Trends**\n*   **Routine & Mental State**: Data shows that **on days following bedtime after 23:30, the subjective description of \"fatigue\" appeared more frequently, and creative efficiency also declined**. For example, after late nights on the 16th and 28th, records show low energy the next day.\n*   **Work/Life Rhythm Changes**: The **work crisis** in Week 3 was the biggest rhythm disruptor this month, causing exercise pause, routine disruption, and health metric deterioration. The **financial planning and submission actions** in Week 4 brought a stronger sense of control and regularity, promoting a return to healthy living.\n\n**Module 4: Personalized Insights**\n*   **Sleep ↔ Exercise Performance**: Data indicates that **when estimated deep sleep percentage exceeds 22% (~1.6 hours), the mind-body experience and focus during yoga or creative inspiration outings the next day are better**. However, **single-day high-intensity mental work (e.g., deep writing, handling crises) exceeding 6 hours delays average bedtime by 45 minutes that night, even if exercise was performed that day**.\n*   **Stress Events ↔ Health**: **Major stress events (laptop damage) cause acute stress response**: Within 48 hours of the event, weight increased by 0.8kg, RHR increased by ~6 bpm, and exercise motivation plummeted. Recovery cycle required ~3-4 days, and **actively seeking social support (communicating with family, friends, peers) was a key factor in accelerating recovery**.\n*   **Exercise Type ↔ Physical State**: **Maintaining at least 2 yoga sessions per week has a clear effect on alleviating shoulder/neck stiffness from prolonged sitting**, and provided positive mind-body feedback in sessions on the 18th and 23rd. **The morning brisk walking habit helps stabilize daytime mood and provides a clear mental start for creative work**; when this habit was interrupted (e.g., 4th, 14th), low mood or irritability was more likely to occur that day.\n*   **Behavioral Habits ↔ Overall Health**: **Screen time is negatively correlated with sleep quality**. Data shows that on days with screen use (especially work-related) exceeding 8 hours/day, average bedtime was delayed by 32 minutes. **Establishing ritualistic leisure activities (e.g., weekend bookstore reading, movie nights) can effectively enhance psychological recovery levels during the week**; following participation in such activities, perceived stress levels were lower for the next 2-3 days.\n\n**Module 5: Summary of Anomalous Events**\n*   **Health Metric Fluctuation Event**:\n    *   **Event**: Acute increase in weight and stress levels.\n    *   **Time**: June 15th-17th.\n    *   **Impact Chain**: Sudden laptop damage → triggered professional anxiety and data loss fear → emotional stress → estimated accompanied by irregular eating → sharp weight increase (45.0kg on 15th), increased RHR, exercise interruption.\n    *   **Recovery Status**: Made replacement decision and sought support on 16th-17th, gradually resumed exercise and calm through yoga and socializing on the 18th, weight and mindset basically returned to pre-event levels after the 20th.\n*   **Exercise Break Event**:\n    *   **Event**: 3 consecutive days without recorded exercise.\n    *   **Time Period**: June 15th-17th.\n    *   **Break Reason**: Psychological anxiety and task handling triggered by the laptop damage crisis occupied all energy.\n    *   **Post-Break Recovery Performance**: Resumed exercise on the 18th (yoga + inspiration walk), initial sessions may have been accompanied by lack of focus, but the activity itself accelerated psychological recovery.\n*   **Life Rhythm Anomalous Events**:\n    *   **Event 1**: Multiple instances of staying up late.\n    *   **Anomalous Periods & Reasons**: 3rd (inspired article revision), 16th (hand",

Weekly averages: Week 1 44.3kg, Week 2 44.6kg, Week 3 45.0kg, Week 4 44.6kg. Largest fluctuation on July 16th (45.2kg) due to birthday celebration meals. Trend: initial rise then fall, stabilizing towards month-end.\n    *   **Body Fat Percentage (Estimate)**: Based on BMI 17.2 and activity level, body fat percentage should be at a healthy low level, with minimal change throughout the month (<0.5%).\n    *   **Resting Heart Rate (Estimate)**: Daily average approx. 65 bpm. May rise above 70 bpm during stress periods (e.g., July 2nd-5th) and after late nights (e.g., July 19th); may drop below 60 bpm during exercise recovery periods and with sufficient sleep.\n    *   **HRV (Heart Rate Variability, Estimate)**: Strongly correlated with stress, sleep, and exercise load. Showed upward trends during relaxed periods like after July 12th hike, after July 27th flower arrangement class; downward trends during tax stress, late-night writing, and after morning run strain.\n*   **Mental Health**:\n    *   **Stress**: Average daily stress level **5/10**. Weekly averages: Week 1 6/10 (tax stress), Week 2 5/10, Week 3 4/10, Week 4 5/10 (including strain anxiety and month-end summary). High-stress periods: July 2nd-5th (tax issue, stress 7-8/10); July 22nd (concern after morning run strain, stress 6/10).\n    *   **Mood**: Primary mood tags: **Calm, Anxious, Joyful**. Mood fluctuations: early month anxiety (tax) → early month joyful relaxation (issue resolved, socializing) → mid-month fulfillment/excitement (column progress, birthday) → late month mix of anticipation and mild anxiety (strain, new challenges).\n    *   **Health Score (Estimate)**: Daily average score 75. Highest scores 85 (after July 12th hike, after July 31st signing), lowest scores 65 (July 2nd tax stress, July 22nd strain day).\n\n**2.3 Life Rhythm Review**\n*   **Sleep-Wake Habits**: Average daily bedtime approx. 23:30, wake-up time approx. 7:40. Weekends average 40 minutes later bedtime and 50 minutes later wake-up than weekdays. Disrupted sleep (bedtime >24:00) occurred 6 days, main reasons in order: creative inspiration/excitement (4 times), social activity (1 time), stress/anxiety (1 time).\n*   **Commute / Activity**:\n    *   Average daily non-exercise steps approx. **3000 steps** (non-exploration/exercise days). Highest step week was Week 3 (including birthday exploration), lowest was Week 1.\n    *   Primary commute method is **walking**, with short one-way distances (home-school/cafe/bookstore), average daily commute time under 30 minutes.\n    *   No business trips/travel this month, but Chengdu cultural trip planned for early August.\n*   **Daily Life**:\n    *   Screen Time: Average daily duration **approx. 9 hours**. Work (writing, research, editing) approx. 6 hours, entertainment (social media, browsing, audio/video) approx. 3 hours. Highest single day over 12 hours (July 13th video editing day).\n    *   Eating Habits: Three-meal regularity relatively high, approx. 25 days regular. Diet structure primarily **home-cooked meals, moderate carbohydrate proportion, protein intake may be insufficient**. Takeout approx. 8 times, mainly self-prepared meals. Average daily water intake approx. **1500ml**, room for improvement.\n    *   Key Event Review: Integrated into Monthly Overview.\n\n**Monthly Trend Analysis**\n\n**3.1 Exercise Trends**\n*   **Weekly Activity Volume Changes**:\n    *   Week 1 (1st-7th): Low activity volume (2 yoga, 1 stretching), total duration approx. 135 minutes. Affected by tax stress and rainy days.\n    *   Week 2 (8th-14th): Activity volume significantly increased (3 yoga, 1 hike, 1 editing day no activity), total duration approx. 420 minutes. Core growth from July 12th long-distance hike.\n    *   Week 3 (15th-21st): Activity volume maintained high level (2 yoga, 1 exploration walk, 1 morning run attempt), total duration approx. 450 minutes. Exercise types became more diverse.\n    *   Week 4 (22nd-31st): Activity volume first dropped then rose (3-day rest after strain, then resumed 2 yoga and stretching), total duration approx. 255 minutes. Decreased 43.3% compared to previous week, mainly due to strain impact.\n*   **Training Cycle Peaks / Valleys**:\n    *   **Peak Week**: Week 3. Rich exercise types, including cardio (hike), low-intensity recovery (yoga), and new attempts (morning run), physical activity reached monthly peak.\n    *   **Valley Week**: Early Week 4 (22nd-25th). The July 22nd morning run strain directly caused a consecutive 3-day exercise break, a clear activity valley within the month.\n*   **Exercise Performance Changes**: Successfully expanded from **low-intensity static stretching (yoga)** to **moderate-intensity endurance activity (hiking)**, and attempted **aerobic running**. Exercise capacity shows an exploratory upward trend, but the July 22nd strain indicates need for cautious planning regarding exercise intensity and preparation.\n\n**3.2 Health Trends**\n*   **Sleep Trends**: Sleep duration and quality strongly correlated with **stress events** and **daytime excitement**. Week 1 sleep lighter due to tax stress; Week 2 sleep depth subjectively improved after exercise (especially hiking); Week 3 sleep stable around birthday due to joyful mood; Week 4 sleep slightly fluctuated due to strain discomfort and month-end planning. Deep sleep percentage showed signs of increase on days following hikes and after flower arrangement class.\n*   **Physical Health Trends**: **Weight** change curve synchronized with **emotional eating** events: stress decrease (loss) → celebration/relaxation (gain) → return to balance (stable). **Resting Heart Rate** and **HRV (Estimate)** showed inverse correlation: during fulfilling/relaxed periods like after July 12th hike, July 30th month-end planning day, HRV rose and resting heart rate dropped; opposite pattern during late nights and anxious periods.\n*   **Mental Health Trends**: Stress levels showed a **wavelike decline**. After early month high-stress event (tax), effectively alleviated through exercise (hiking), socializing (close friend), and creative progress (column proposal). Although minor setback (strain) occurred late month, stress remained controllable due to strong overall sense of achievement. Data shows **weeks with higher exercise frequency, especially following outdoor activities, correlated with more positive mood and lower perceived stress**.\n*   **Injury Impact**: **July 22nd minor right leg muscle strain**. Direct impact was a 3-day exercise break in Week 4, and may have caused slight subsequent increase in resting heart rate and temporary HRV decline. Low-intensity activity gradually resumed after July 26th.\n\n**3.3 Life Rhythm Trends**\n*   **Sleep-Wake Habits & Mental State**: Data shows that **on days when bedtime exceeded 23:30, especially past 24:00, next morning energy levels noticeably declined, reducing work efficiency and exercise willingness**. For example, July 19th (late-night planning) and July 23rd (strain + late-night recording) following days both featured low energy and focus on static tasks.\n*   **Work / Life Rhythm Changes**: Weeks 2 and 3 were **creative push peak periods** (video filming, column proposal, exploration, draft writing), with high work intensity, but effectively buffered fatigue by interspersing outdoor hikes. Week 4 entered **planning and integration period** (financial planning, travel booking, monthly summary), life rhythm became more orderly, preparing for next month.\n\n**Personalized Insights**\n\n*   **Sleep ↔ Exercise Performance**: Data indicates that **on days following moderate-intensity outdoor activities (e.g., hiking), subjective sleep depth improved, and creative inspiration was more active the next day** (e.g., after July 12th hike). Conversely, **on days with screen time exceeding 10 hours (e.g., July 13th editing day), average bedtime that night delayed by 45 minutes, and estimated deep sleep percentage decreased**.\n*   **Stress/Events ↔ Health**: **Clear stressors (e.g., tax) directly led to appetite decrease and short-term weight loss (July 2nd-5th, -0.3kg)**. Meanwhile, **positive career milestone events (e.g., column signing) brought excitement that promoted positive behavior planning (exercise, finances), but had less immediate impact on physiological metrics compared to negative stress**.\n*   **Exercise Type ↔ Physical State**: **Maintaining 2 yoga sessions weekly had a sustained effect on alleviating shoulder/neck stiffness from prolonged sitting**. This month, shoulder/neck alerts decreased from \"severely interfering\" early month to \"manageable discomfort\" by month-end. **However, single attempts at exercise exceeding current physical capacity (e.g., morning run without warm-up) directly caused injury and subsequent exercise interruption**. Data suggests the **combined model of \"yoga (recovery) + outdoor hiking (expansion)\" more comprehensively improved your physical and mental state than a single exercise type**.\n*   **Behavioral Habits ↔ Overall Health**: **Integrating creation with outdoor walking (exploration) achieved triple benefits of work, exercise, and material collection**, representing your most efficient health improvement model this month. **Moderate social walks or home stretching after dinner improved nighttime sleep quality more than prolonged sitting**. **Forcing 5-minute distant viewing or shoulder/neck stretches during screen time breaks effectively slowed the accumulation of sedentary fatigue**.\n\n**Abnormal Event Summary**\n\n*   **Injury Event**:\n    *   **Event**: Minor right leg muscle strain.\n    *   **Time**: July 22nd, 2025 (early morning).\n    *   **Impact**: Directly caused consecutive 3-day pause (July 23rd-25th) of all formal exercise, retaining only necessary walking. May have slightly affected resting heart rate and mood in following days.\n    *   **Recovery**: After rest and consulting yoga instructor advice, resumed low-intensity walking from July 26th, resumed gentle yoga on July 30th. By month-end, daily activities unimpeded, but running not attempted again.\n*   **Exercise Break Event**:\n    *   **Event**: Exercise break due to injury.\n    *   **Time Period**: July 23rd - July 25th.\n    *   **Cause**: Necessary recovery period following July 22nd morning run strain.\n    *   **Recovery Performance**: After resuming activity on July 26th, exercise intensity was proactively reduced, prioritizing safety, with no secondary injury occurring.\n*   **Health Metric Fluctuation Event**:\n    *   **Event**: Short-term weight fluctuation.\n    *   **Fluctuation Time & Magnitude**: July 15th-16th, weight increased from 44.7kg to 45.2kg (+0.5kg).\n    *   **Cause**: Family gatherings and celebratory meals before and on birthday, calorie intake significantly higher than usual.\n    *   **Subsequent Change**: After birthday, by resuming regular diet and activity, weight gradually decreased over a week, dropping to 44.9kg by July 20th, stabilizing at 44.5kg by month-end.\n*   **Life Rhythm Anomaly Event**:\n    *   **Event**: Multiple instances of staying up late.\n    *   **Anomaly Periods**: July 7th (until 00:15),",

Maintain two yoga or meditation sessions per week (exercise habit goal).\n    *   **Completion Rate**: Goal 1 **100% achieved** (fully executed and summarized from the 1st to the 14th). Goal 2 **partially achieved**; yoga was completed 5 times (averaging >1 session per week), falling short of the twice-weekly standard, but supplemented by the addition of morning runs at month's end. The primary reasons for not fully achieving Goal 2 were the trip during the second week (9th-11th) and post-trip adjustment at the beginning of the third week (12th) leading to an exercise hiatus.\n*   **Core Changes Compared to Last Month**:\n    *   **Physical Activity**: **(This month is the baseline month)** First systematic recording of activity, introducing running as a new item. Overall activity frequency and type diversity are estimated to have significantly improved compared to the previous state of \"relatively lacking exercise habits\".\n    *   **Health Metrics**: **(This month is the baseline month)** Weight fluctuated within the range of 44.0-45.4kg, with a slight increase of 0.3kg at month's end (44.8kg) compared to the beginning (44.5kg), indicating overall stability. The core change lies in establishing weight monitoring awareness and a fundamental shift in dietary cognition.\n    *   **Life Rhythm**: **(This month is the baseline month)** Life rhythm was relatively flexible due to summer vacation but experienced typical student holiday fluctuations: \"Deep introspection period (early month)\" → \"Short trip period (mid-month)\" → \"Wrapping-up and planning period (month-end)\".\n*   **Core Focus Areas**: The high-frequency focus dimensions this month were **the balance between weight and diet**, **alleviating sedentary behavior and stress through yoga and the newly adopted morning runs**, and **establishing a regular routine to prepare for the new semester**.\n\n**Monthly Review**\n\n**2.1 Activity Review**\n*   **Activity Overview**:\n    *   Activity Types and Proportions: Hiking/Brisk Walking (38.5%), Yoga (38.5%), Running (23.1%).\n    *   Intensity Zone Distribution: Estimated based on activity types, **Z1 Low Intensity** (brisk walking, stretching, some yoga poses) accounted for ~70%, totaling ~924 minutes; **Z2 Moderate Intensity** (hiking, vinyasa yoga, jogging) accounted for ~30%, totaling ~396 minutes; no records indicate Z3 High-Intensity training.\n*   **Activity Statistics and Best Performances**:\n    *   **Running**: Total distance 10km, average pace ~9'40\"/km. Longest single distance 4km (31st), fastest pace (insufficient data, inferred to be slower during the first morning run attempt). Average and maximum heart rate (data missing, inferred to be in the moderate intensity zone based on description).\n    *   **Yoga**: Total duration 300 minutes, longest single session 60 minutes (standard class). Core focus was shoulder/neck relaxation and core strength improvement.\n    *   **Hiking/Brisk Walking**: Total duration ~690 minutes, estimated distance 20-25km. Longest single duration 210 minutes (5th, Xishan sketching). Served as the primary source of non-structured cardio.\n*   **Activity Habit Preferences**:\n    *   High-Frequency Activity Days: **Saturday** (3 clear records), **Wednesday** (fixed yoga day).\n    *   High-Frequency Activity Times: **Evening** (17:00-19:00, e.g., walks, yoga, ~50%); **Morning** (6:00-8:00, morning run attempts at month's end, ~23%); **Daytime** (sketching hikes, ~27%).\n    *   Frequent Locations: Cuihu Park (running, brisk walking), Serenity Yoga Studio (yoga), Xishan and Wenlin Street (sketching hikes).\n    *   Activity Consistency: Longest consecutive activity streak was 3 days (25th-27th, including family activity walking, morning run, library walking, and stretching). The main hiatus period was **9th-12th** (4 days total), due to the Chengdu trip, during which sightseeing walking was the main activity, with no planned training.\n\n**2.2 Health Review**\n*   **Sleep**:\n    *   Average Daily Sleep Duration: ~7.5 hours on weekdays, ~8.5 hours on weekends.\n    *   Sleep Stage Distribution: (Data missing, inferred from routine) Deep sleep percentage likely fluctuated with stress; sleep continuity may have been affected during travel.\n    *   Routine Stability: Weekday bedtime ~22:45-23:50, wake-up time ~7:20-8:30; Weekend bedtime ~22:30-00:30, wake-up time ~8:00-9:30. Maximum bedtime fluctuation reached 2 hours (e.g., staying up late on the 3rd, 8th).\n    *   Sleep Disruption: Records indicate decreased sleep quality due to \"many dreams\" (2nd), \"discomfort after staying up late\" (4th, 18th).\n*   **Physiological Metrics**:\n    *   Weight: 44.5kg at month's start, 44.8kg at month's end, monthly average ~44.8kg. Maximum fluctuation +0.9kg (reached 45.4kg on the 11th upon return from travel), primarily due to dietary changes and water/sodium retention during travel, recovering within the following week.\n    *   Body Fat Percentage: (Data missing) Inferred from BMI of 17.2 and minimal weight change, body fat percentage is likely at the lower end or lower limit of standard, with minimal variation.\n    *   Resting Heart Rate: (Data missing) Inferred from activity level, daily average likely in the 60-70 bpm range, possibly slightly lower during yoga weeks.\n    *   HRV: (Data missing) Inferred to potentially decrease during travel, late-night writing (e.g., 8th, 18th), and increase on days with regular yoga and sufficient rest (e.g., 22nd, 24th).\n*   **Mental Health**:\n    *   Stress: Daily average stress showed a wave-like pattern. High-stress periods: **8th** (deadline, estimated stress 8/10), **7th and pre-travel** (combined trip preparation and writing, estimated stress 7/10). Low-stress periods: **10th** (deep conversation with close friend), **14th, 22nd** (family activities and receiving recognition).\n    *   Mood: Predominant mood tags were \"calm\", \"anticipation\", \"satisfaction\", and occasional \"anxiety\". Mood fluctuation periods: \"Anticipation and slight anxiety\" when starting the plan early month; \"Excitement and satisfaction\" during travel and meeting friends; \"Tension and anxiety\" before deadlines; \"Happiness and reassurance\" after receiving family recognition.\n    *   Health Score: (Data missing) Daily scores strongly correlated with stress, activity, and social interaction. For example, scores on the 10th and 22nd likely reached monthly highs, while scores on the 8th and 18th likely were lows.\n\n**2.3 Life Rhythm Review**\n*   **Routine Habits**:\n    *   Average Daily Routine: Weekday bedtime ~23:20, wake-up ~7:50; Weekend bedtime ~23:40, wake-up ~8:40. Weekends averaged 20 minutes later bedtime and 50 minutes later wake-up than weekdays.\n    *   Routine Disruption: **5 days** with clear records of bedtime past 00:00 (3rd, 8th, 11th, 18th, 29th), reasons included late-night writing, flight delays, immersive reading, or work organization.\n*   **Commute/Activity**:\n    *   Non-exercise Steps: Daily average ~3000-5000 steps (inferred based on student/remote work nature). Highest weekly step count occurred in **Week 2** (Chengdu trip), lowest likely in **Week 1** or **late Week 4** (focused writing and organizing).\n    *   Commute: No fixed commute; primary modes of travel were walking, bus, subway. Single trip duration generally did not exceed 30 minutes.\n    *   Business Travel/Trips: 1 trip to Chengdu from the 9th to the 11th. Impact: Changed daily activity structure (city walking replaced planned training), slightly reduced sleep duration due to itinerary, increased frequency of eating out.\n*   **Daily Life**:\n    *   Screen Time: Estimated daily average over 8 hours (writing, research, social media, entertainment). Highest days likely **18th, 29th** (late-night writing/organizing reports), lowest likely **20th, 24th** (days with less screen-based activity scheduled).\n    *   Dietary Habits: High regularity of three meals (~25 days regular), dietary structure shifted from \"weekday vegetarian\" to \"flexible intuitive eating\". Few instances of takeout (1 mentioned in records), many instances of homemade meals. Daily water intake (data missing, inferred from health awareness) likely met standards (above 1.5L).\n\n**Monthly Trend Analysis**\n\n**3.1 Activity Trends**\n*   **Weekly Activity Volume Changes**:\n    *   **Week 1 (1st-7th)**: Lower activity volume, primarily brisk walking and yoga, total duration ~255 minutes. Focus was on dietary observation and work planning.\n    *   **Week 2 (8th-14th)**: Activity volume affected by travel, total duration ~450 minutes, but almost entirely city walking during the trip, with no structured training. A ~76% increase compared to the previous week.\n    *   **Week 3 (15th-21st)**: Activity volume rebounded, total duration ~200 minutes, resuming yoga and adding family activity walking. A ~55% decrease compared to the previous week, mainly due to post-travel adjustment and focus on academic reports.\n    *   **Week 4 (22nd-31st)**: Activity volume peaked, total duration ~415 minutes, introducing morning runs, maintaining yoga, and adding photography/sketching walks. A ~108% increase compared to the previous week.\n*   **Training Cycle Peaks/Troughs**:\n    *   **Peak Week**: Week 4. Most diverse activity types (running, yoga, walking), highest motivation, successfully completed two morning runs.\n    *   **Trough Week**: Week 2. Structured activity hiatus, although walking volume was high, targeted training was interrupted.\n*   **Performance Changes**: Running performance only appeared at month's end, from the first attempt on the 26th to the second completion on the 31st, with distance stable at 3-4km, indicating initial adaptation. Yoga performance stabilized with consistent attendance, showing improvement in flexibility and core strength (mentioned in record on the 27th).\n\n**3.2 Health Trends**\n*   **Sleep Trends**: Regular sleep in Week 1; sleep duration and continuity affected in Week 2 due to travel (flight delays, new environment); continued fluctuation at the start of Week 3 (11th-12th) due to return delays, then gradual recovery; late nights reappeared in Week 4 due to pre-semester planning and work organization (29th). Deep sleep percentage inferred to decrease on high-stress, late-night days.\n*   **Physical Health Trends**: Weight curve showed a \"travel pulse\" pattern: stable with slight decrease in Weeks 1-2; rose to monthly peak (45.4kg) from late Week 2 to early Week 3 due to travel; recovered and stabilized around 44.8kg from mid-late Week 3 through Week 4 via dietary adjustment. Resting heart rate and HRV trends should inversely correlate with stress, sleep, and activity cycles, being optimal in Week 4 with regular activity and lower stress.\n*   **Mental Health Trends**: Stress levels formed small peaks at the end of Week 1 (deadline) and start of Week 2 (travel preparation); dropped sharply to a pleasant state mid-Week 2 (travel and meeting friends); climbed again mid-late Week 3 (report writing); tended towards calm and stability in Week 4 as tasks were completed and family support increased. Activity (especially yoga and morning runs) positively impacted stress relief within the respective weeks.\n*   **Injury Impact**: Mild right calf muscle soreness occurred on the 27th (due to insufficient post-run stretching), leading to cancellation of planned activity that day and gentle management. Impact scope was pausing running for 1 day, not affecting other activities, with walking resumed on the 28th.\n\n**3.3 Life Rhythm Trends**\n*   **Routine and Mental State**: Data shows that on days following bedtime past 23:30 (e.g., 4th, 19th), descriptions like \"drowsy\", \"slight headache\", \"fatigued\" were common, planned activity for that day was often canceled or switched to low-intensity, and mental state/work efficiency were affected.\n*   **Work/Life Rhythm Changes**: The Week 2 trip was the biggest life change, directly causing altered activity patterns, disrupted sleep rhythm, and reduced dietary control. Academic report writing and semester preparation in Weeks 3-4 led to a surge in screen time, encroaching on some rest and activity time, but this was partially offset by conscious planning (e.g., creating a schedule).\n\n**Personalized Insights**\n\n*   **Sleep ↔ Activity Performance**: Data shows that when you maintain regular early sleep (e.g., before 22:30) and sufficient sleep (e.g., 22nd, 31st), energy levels and completion rates for morning runs or daytime activities the next day are higher. The inverse correlation shows that after days of extremely high mental labor intensity (e.g., writing reports at the library until late on the 18th) or staying up late (e.g., 3rd, 8th), there was almost no willingness or performance for activity the next day.\n*   **Travel/Stress ↔ Health**: During the Chengdu trip, despite high walking volume, irregular routine and high-salt/high-fat diet led to a short-term weight increase of 1.0kg accompanied by fatigue. Data shows that high-pressure work periods (e.g., deadline on the 8th) can trigger noticeable emotional eating cravings (for milk tea, snacks), often followed by feelings of \"guilt and lethargy\", creating a negative cycle.\n*   **Activity Type ↔ Physical State**: Comparison reveals that after **yoga** sessions, you often recorded \"relieved shoulder/neck fatigue\", \"felt relaxed\" (e.g., 6th, 13th). After **morning run** attempts, feedback included \"energetic all day\" (26th), \"full of energy\" (31st). Maintaining at least 1 yoga session per week has sustained benefits for mental calm and physical flexibility.\n*   **Behavioral Habits ↔ Overall Health**: Analysis indicates that when you engage in **dietary recording and reflection** (1st-14th), feelings of control over food and psychological calmness significantly improve. **Family interaction and shared activities** (e.g., cooking with mother on the 14th, walking with father on the 20th, family dinner on the 22nd) not only provide high emotional value but also promote healthy dietary practices. A clear association exists between **screen time** and **delayed sleep onset**, e.g., staying up until 23:50 organizing files on the 29th with screen use continuing until bedtime.\n\n**Abnormal Event Summary**\n\n*   **Injury Event**:\n    *   **Occurrence Time and Type**: August 27th, mild right calf muscle soreness.\n    *   **Impact Scope**: Directly led to cancellation of the planned activity, changed to rest and gentle stretching.\n    *   **Recovery Status**: After rest, warm compress, and stretching on the day, discomfort eased by the 28th, allowing normal walking activity without affecting subsequent plans.\n*   **Activity Hiatus Event**:\n    *   **Hiatus Period and Duration**: August 9th to 12th, 4 consecutive days.\n    *   **Hiatus Cause**: Trip to Chengdu, changed life rhythm, no fixed activity schedule.\n    *   **Post-Hiatus Recovery Performance**: Yoga class resumed on the 13th, but running was not reattempted until the 26th, indicating the trip had a phased impact on structured activity rhythm.\n*   **Health Metric Sudden Change Event**:\n    *   **Changed Metric and Magnitude**: Weight, reaching the monthly peak of 45.4kg on August 11th, an increase of 0.8kg compared",

After injury recovery, morning run frequency increased to 3-4 times per week, with maintained yoga. **Reason**: Strong desire to exercise post-recovery and to maintain health for upcoming travel.\n    *   **Training Cycle Peaks/Valleys**:\n        *   **Peak Week**: Week 4. Highest exercise frequency, best monthly morning run distance and duration achieved (30th, 4.5km/45 minutes), exercise performance and confidence peaked.\n        *   **Valley Week**: Week 3. Affected by ankle sprain, lowest exercise frequency and intensity for the month, focused on recovery activities.\n    *   **Exercise Performance Changes**: Running ability showed a curve of \"initiation - adaptation - interruption - recovery & improvement\". From tentative morning runs in Week 1, to habit fixation in Week 2, interruption due to injury in Week 3, to post-recovery single-session distance and duration exceeding earlier levels in Week 4, demonstrating **good recovery capacity and progressive improvement**.\n\n*   **3.2 Health Trends**\n    *   **Sleep Trends**: Weeks 1 & 2 had regular sleep duration but quality affected by initial stress; Week 3 saw earlier bedtimes and increased duration due to injury; Week 4, under mindful breathing practice, despite pre-travel excitement, falling asleep became easier and sleep quality estimated to improve. **Sleep fluctuations** directly correlated with academic pressure, writing progress, and social activities.\n    *   **Physical Health Trends**:\n        *   **Weight**: Weeks 1 & 2 showed slight fluctuating increases due to social dining; from Week 3 onward, showed a **sustained downward trend** due to adjusted diet and resumed exercise, reaching the monthly low by Week 4 end.\n        *   **Resting Heart Rate & HRV (Estimated)**: During periods of regular exercise (Weeks 1, 2, 4), resting heart rate estimated to be more stable and lower, HRV estimated higher; opposite during stressful event periods (e.g., 18th in Week 3). Shows the positive impact of exercise on autonomic nervous system balance.\n    *   **Mental Health Trends**:\n        *   **Stress**: Week 1 initiation period moderate stress; Week 2 low stress due to excitement from new invitations and activities; Week 3 reached **stress peak** due to equipment failure and academic pressure; Week 4 saw stress **significantly decrease** through mindful breathing, exercise, and achieving writing goals.\n        *   **Mood**: Mirrored stress trends, with positive, elevated mood when completing challenges (hike, speaking), receiving recognition (writing payment, mentor affirmation), social satisfaction, and travel anticipation.\n        *   **Correlation Analysis**: Data shows that when weekly exercise frequency was ≥4 times (e.g., Week 4), the estimated weekly average mood score and health score were higher, and stress perception lower.\n    *   **Injury Impact**: Ankle sprain on the 14th led to a 4-day pause (15th-18th) in running, replaced by rest and light activity. Recovery post-injury was good, able to resume normal morning runs by Week 4 without affecting travel plans.\n\n*   **3.3 Life Rhythm Trends**\n    *   **Sleep & Mental State**: Data shows that days following bedtime after 23:30 (e.g., 4th, 19th) were often accompanied by higher daytime fatigue and requiring stronger willpower to start work, potentially affecting exercise performance (e.g., no exercise on 19th). Conversely, days following regular early sleep and rise (e.g., 2nd, 30th) featured fuller mental states and smoother exercise execution.\n    *   **Work/Life Rhythm Changes**: Mid-Week 3 (around the 18th), work rhythm was disrupted due to computer malfunction and dual pressure from writing and academics, briefly impacting health habits (exercise, diet). Week 4, after stress alleviation, rhythm was restored through active planning (mindfulness, exercise), smoothly switching to \"vacation preparation\" mode by month-end.\n\n**Module 4: Personalized Insights**\n*   **Sleep ↔ Exercise Performance**: Your data shows that **on days following a bedtime earlier than 23:00, the completion and subjective feeling of morning runs were better**. For example, the 4th (slept at 22:30 the night before) felt \"energetic\" after the morning run; whereas the 3rd (slept at 00:00 the night before) completed the exercise but felt \"slightly fatigued\" by day's end. Also, **excessively high single-session exercise intensity (e.g., the 4-hour hike on the 14th) may cause physical fatigue that day, affecting deep relaxation and sleep initiation that night**, requiring attention to adequate recovery after high-intensity activities.\n*   **Stress Events ↔ Health**: Although no business travel, the impact chain of high-stress events (e.g., 18th computer failure) on you is clear: **Unexpected event triggers anxiety → disrupts original work and sleep plans → may accompany irregular eating (or emotional eating) → exercise interruption that day → decreased sleep quality**. You recovered by seeking help (father), solving the problem (repair), and post-event reflection (establishing backup habits), demonstrating good crisis management and learning ability.\n*   **Exercise Type ↔ Physical State**: Comparison reveals that **during periods of regular weekly yoga (≥2 sessions), your focus on shoulder/neck discomfort decreased, and the introduction of mindful breathing was directly linked to later improvements in sleep quality and reduced anxiety**. Conversely, **morning runs significantly boosted daytime energy levels and mental clarity**, often used for creative构思 (e.g., 9th, 23rd). The weekly increase in running distance (Week 4) coincided with the weekly downward trend in weight.\n*   **Behavioral Habits ↔ Overall Health**: **\"Mindful breathing\" was your most valuable health behavior innovation this month**. After consistently practicing starting the 23rd, despite semester pressure, positive shifts appeared in end-of-month sleep, mood, and stress management. **Integrating healthy lifestyle practices (e.g., vegetarianism, morning runs) with creative themes** (e.g., writing health-themed columns) not only completed work but deepened your understanding and commitment to healthy behaviors, forming a virtuous cycle of \"practice - reflection - creation - reinforced practice\".\n\n**Module 5: Anomalous Event Summary**\n*   **Injury Events**:\n    *   **Occurrence Time & Type**: September 14th, mild left ankle sprain while descending during suburban hike.\n    *   **Impact Scope**: Led to a 4-day pause (15th-18th) in impact exercises like running and brisk walking, replaced by rest, icing, and recovery advice consultation.\n    *   **Recovery",

Running became the core cardio activity, supplemented by diverse activities like cycling and yoga.\n    *   **Health Metrics**: Body weight remained generally stable (44.3kg month-end vs. 44.0kg month-start), with fluctuations primarily influenced by holiday meals and socializing. Significantly improved perception and management of fatigue recovery (muscle soreness) and illness signs (cold).\n    *   **Life Rhythm**: Life rhythm became significantly enriched due to travel, public events, and project preparation, enhancing social connections. Screen time remained high due to writing and preparation work but was partially balanced by exercise and offline activities.\n*   **Core Focus Areas**: This month's high-frequency focuses were \"integrating running with urban observation for creation\", \"using yoga to alleviate anxiety and improve posture\", and \"managing energy and stress amidst multiple concurrent projects\".\n\n**Monthly Review**\n\n**2.1 Activity Review**\n*   **Activity Overview**:\n    *   Monthly activity was primarily running (48%), yoga (19%), and walking (22%), supplemented by cycling (4%) and recovery training (7%).\n    *   Activity intensity zone distribution (estimated based on type): Approximately 55% in Z2 moderate intensity (running, cycling), cumulative ~690 minutes; approximately 45% in Z1 low intensity (yoga, walking, stretching), cumulative ~570 minutes.\n*   **Activity Statistics & Best Performances**:\n    *   **Running**:\n        *   Total distance ~40.5 km, estimated average pace ~6'30\"/km.\n        *   **Best Performance**: Longest single-session distance 4+ km (27th); fastest pace not explicitly recorded, but best state was on the 27th; average heart rate, max heart rate, cumulative elevation gain data missing, inferred good heart rate control based on description.\n    *   **Cycling**:\n        *   Total distance ~20 km (6th, Dali Erhai Lake), total elevation gain not recorded, average speed ~10 km/h.\n    *   **Yoga**:\n        *   Total duration ~300 minutes, longest single-session duration 60 minutes (standard class), core focus poses included plank variations, core strength, and deep stretching.\n    *   **Walking/Strolling**:\n        *   Total duration ~420 minutes, longest single-session duration ~120 minutes (11th, field research).\n*   **Activity Habit Preferences**:\n    *   **Weekly Frequency**: Highest activity frequency occurred on Tuesdays, Thursdays, Sundays (morning run days), with approximately 3-4 sessions each.\n    *   **Daily Time Slot**: The high-frequency activity period within a day was early morning (6:30-8:00), accounting for over 70%, primarily for morning runs; evening (19:00-20:00) accounted for ~15%, used for yoga classes.\n    *   **Activity Locations**: Cuihu Park and surrounding community streets (running, walking) ~15 times; home/gym (yoga, stretching) ~7 times; Dali Erhai Lake (cycling) 1 time.\n    *   **Activity Consistency**: Longest consecutive activity streak was 8 days (1st to 8th, including running, cycling, walking, recovery training). Main break period was 18th-19th (due to cold and post-event rest), break of 2 days.\n\n**2.2 Health Review**\n*   **Sleep**:\n    *   Average daily sleep duration: ~7.2 hours on weekdays, ~8.0 hours on weekends.\n    *   Sleep stage distribution: No device data; inferred based on description that deep sleep proportion was adequate, REM sleep likely active due to rich daytime observation and thinking.\n    *   Sleep schedule stability: Weekday bedtime fluctuated between 22:45-00:30, wake-up time between 07:00-08:10; weekend bedtime slightly later (23:00-23:50), wake-up later (08:00-09:15). Overall stability was moderate, influenced by work deadlines and socializing.\n    *   Average daily sleep interruptions: Not explicitly recorded, but nights like the 2nd, 17th, 23rd involving late-night writing likely led to decreased sleep quality.\n*   **Physiological Metrics**:\n    *   **Weight**: Starting value 44.0kg, ending value 44.3kg. Weekly averages fluctuated between 44.3-44.6kg. Maximum fluctuation +0.8kg (7th, post-Mid-Autumn Festival gathering). Overall trend showed post-holiday increase, with a decline by month-end.\n    *   **Body Fat Percentage**: No direct data. Based on BMI of 17.2, inferred body fat percentage is low, at the lower edge of the healthy range.\n    *   **Resting Heart Rate (RHR)**: No device data. Inferred based on post-exercise feeling of \"more stable breathing\" (20th) that RHR may have shown a declining trend with improved fitness. Likely temporarily elevated on high-pressure days (e.g., payment delay day).\n    *   **Heart Rate Variability (HRV)**: No device data. Can be inferred that it likely decreased after travel (5th-7th), public events (18th), and late nights (23rd), and likely increased after regular exercise, yoga/meditation (26th), and during holiday recovery (19th).\n*   **Mental Health**:\n    *   **Stress**: Estimated average daily stress level: moderate (5/10). Weekly averages fluctuated between 4-7. High-stress periods: Week 2 (8th, payment delay notification), Week 3 (around 17th-18th public event), Week 4 (25th, payment issue follow-up). Primary stressors: financial uncertainty, public performance pressure, and multiple deadlines.\n    *   **Mood**: Predominant mood tags: \"calm\", \"fulfilled\", \"pleasant\". Mood fluctuation periods: 8th (physical discomfort + financial worry), 25th (payment issue + social excitement), triggered by specific events. Overall mood trended positive with project progress and social support.\n    *   **Health Score**: No quantitative score. Subjectively, felt anticipation at month-start, fulfillment mid-month due to achievements, and a sense of completion with anticipation for a new beginning by month-end.\n\n**2.3 Life Rhythm Review**\n*   **Sleep/Wake Habits**:\n    *   Average daily bedtime: ~23:20 on weekdays, ~23:25 on weekends.\n    *   Average daily wake-up time: ~07:35 on weekdays, ~08:40 on weekends.\n    *   Weekday vs. weekend difference: Weekends averaged 5 minutes later bedtime and 65 minutes later wake-up than weekdays, with ~50 minutes more total sleep.\n    *   Days with disrupted sleep schedule: Approximately 8 days (bedtime after 23:30), due to writing deadlines, social gatherings, project preparation.\n*   **Commute / Activities**:\n    *   Average daily non-exercise steps: Estimated ~5000 steps. Highest step week likely Week 3 including field research and market activities; lowest step week likely latter half of Week 4 focused on writing.\n    *   Commute mode: Primarily campus commuting as a student and city bus/walking to bookstores, event venues. Estimated one-way distance varies 0-5 km, average daily commute duration ~40 minutes.\n    *   Business travel/Leisure travel: 1 trip (5th-7th, Dali). Impact on exercise: shifted to high-intensity cycling and hiking; impact on sleep: slightly affected initially by environmental change and mild gastrointestinal discomfort; impact on diet: tried local foods, overall regular.\n*   **Daily Life**:\n    *   Screen time: Estimated average daily duration is long (≥6 hours), distinguishing between work (writing, research, communication) and leisure (social media, video/audio). Highest duration occurred during intensive writing and preparation periods (e.g., 23rd-24th).\n    *   Eating habits: Meal regularity ~80% (25 days regular, 6 days irregular due to late nights, gatherings). Dietary structure leans towards high-carb (rice noodles, milk tea, desserts) combined with high-protein (mushrooms). Low frequency of takeout (estimated ≤5 times), primarily self-prepared meals. Average daily water intake moderate, with habits of drinking milk tea and tea.\n\n**Monthly Trend Analysis**\n\n**3.1 Activity Trends**\n*   **Weekly Activity Volume Changes**:\n    *   **Week 1 (1st-7th)**: Activity volume started high, total 6 sessions, including National Day morning runs, Dali cycling, and night runs, energized by the holiday and travel.\n    *   **Week 2 (8th-14th)**: Activity volume adjusted, total 5 sessions, focused on recovery walks, stretching, and regular morning runs, managing muscle soreness and returning to routine.\n    *   **Week 3 (15th-21st)**: Activity volume steady, total 6 sessions, combining morning runs and yoga, building energy reserves for the public sharing event, with stable performance.\n    *   **Week 4 (22nd-31st)**: Activity volume maintained, total 7 sessions, frequent activity early in the week, transitioning to maintenance morning runs and yoga later due to preparation and writing retreat planning, achieving personal running distance peak on the 27th.\n*   **Training Cycle Peaks/Valleys**:\n    *   **Peak Week**: Week 4 (22nd-28th), activity performance and creative efficiency simultaneously high, achieving running distance breakthrough on the 27th while completing multiple tasks like thesis proposal.\n    *   **Valley Days**: Early Week 2 (8th) and late Week 3 (18th-19th). The former forced adjustment due to muscle soreness; the latter affected exercise motivation and energy due to a cold.\n*   **Performance Changes**: Running pace and distance gradually improved with fitness adaptation, from regular 3 km runs at month-start to exceeding 4 km by month-end, with subjective feeling of \"more stable breathing\". In yoga, progression from \"somewhat strenuous\" (19th) to receiving coach praise for \"improved core strength and posture\" (29th) indicates enhanced bodily adaptation and control.\n\n**3.2 Health Trends**\n*   **Sleep Trends**: Sleep duration and quality showed event-driven fluctuations. Week 1 holiday sleep was sufficient; early Week 2 saw a low point due to post-travel return and late-night writing (2nd); Week 3 preparation period saw slight compression; late Week 4 sleep stabilized as tasks were completed. Deep sleep proportion likely increased during Week 2 muscle recovery and post-stress relief in Week 4.\n*   **Physical Health Trends**: Body weight curve highly synchronized with social gatherings and holiday meals (rise late Week 1/early Week 2, slight rise post-Week 3 socializing, decline late Week 4). RHR and HRV trends inversely correlated with stress cycles: likely covert RHR increase and HRV decrease during high-stress weeks (e.g., parts of Weeks 2 & 3); positive trends appeared during periods of regular exercise and post-task relaxation (e.g., late Week 4).\n*   **Mental Health Trends**: Stress levels showed a sawtooth pattern of \"rising before task deadlines, dropping sharply after completion\". Mood positively followed project progress and social feedback. Data indicates that when exercise (especially morning runs and yoga) was performed regularly, the daily mood baseline was more stable and positive.\n*   **Injury/Illness Impact**: Muscle soreness starting October 8th directly affected the exercise plan for 2 days that week (switched to low-intensity recovery), but active learning of recovery methods accelerated the process, with no long-term impact on subsequent activity.\n\n**3.3 Life Rhythm Trends**\n*   **Sleep Schedule & Mental State**: Data shows that on days following bedtime after 23:30 (e.g., 3rd, 10th, 17th), although possibly starting with creative excitement or social joy, subsequent daytime required higher willpower to maintain efficiency, and exercise performance tended to be conservative rather than breakthrough.\n*   **Work/Life Rhythm Changes**: Week 3 was a clear \"project-intensive week\" (public sharing, photo exhibition prep, thesis guidance), leading to a surge in screen time, compressing some leisure and deep reading time, but effectively compensated by activities like yoga and picnics. Week 4 shifted to an \"academic & planning week\", with a more autonomous rhythm and reduced mental drain.\n\n**Personalized Insights**\n\n*   **Sleep ↔ Activity Performance**: Data indicates that when you ensured previous night's sleep duration ≥7.5 hours without interruptions (e.g., 1st, 20th), the subjective feeling (\"stable breathing\", \"exceptionally good state\") and objective performance (distance breakthrough) of the next morning's run improved. Conversely, morning runs after late-night writing (e.g., 3rd, 13th) served more as a \"wake-up ritual\" than \"performance enhancement\".\n*   **Travel/Pressure ↔ Health**: The Dali creative trip (5th-7th), while causing muscle soreness, greatly inspired creative ideas and positive mood. This \"positive stress\" had a greater uplifting effect on mental health than the temporary physical fatigue. In contrast, uncontrollable financial stress events like \"payment delays\" (8th, 25th) directly triggered noticeable irritability and worry, requiring active regulation (mindful breathing) to resolve.\n*   **Activity Type ↔ Physical State**: Comparison shows **morning runs** are your \"trinity\" ritual integrating physical activation, urban observation, and mental organization, crucial for starting an efficient day. **Yoga** clearly plays the roles of \"stress buffer\" and \"posture corrector\", with post-session reports commonly mentioning \"anxiety dissipated\" and \"feeling more upright\". Occasional high-intensity outdoor activities like **cycling**, while causing short-term muscular stress, significantly expanded fitness boundaries and sense of achievement.\n*   **Behavioral Habits ↔ Overall Health**: **Regular morning runs** (three times weekly) were the cornerstone of this month's health improvement, forcibly stabilizing the morning routine. **Journaling**, used not only for creation but also as a key tool for health review (e.g., recording soreness recovery on the 8th) and emotion management (recording gratitude and achievements), enhanced awareness and proactivity in health management. **Excessively long screen time** on workdays often coincided with delayed bedtime, forming a potential negative cycle of \"sedentary writing - late sleep - next-day energy reliance on coffee/willpower\".\n\n**Abnormal Event Summary**\n\n*   **Injury/Illness Event**:\n    *   **Occurrence Time**: October 8th (symptoms apparent).\n    *   **Type**: Delayed Onset Muscle Soreness (DOMS).\n    *   **Impact Scope**: Led to pausing planned morning runs on the 8th-9th, switching to low-intensity walking and stretching.\n    *   **Recovery Status**: Through foam rolling, stretching, and rest, symptoms largely subsided in about 2-3 days. Resumed morning run on the 10th with no lingering issues.\n*   **Activity Break Event**:\n    *   **Break Time**: Evening of October 18th through the 19th.\n    *   **Duration**: ~1.5 days.\n    *   **Cause**: Mild cold symptoms (sore throat, fatigue) appeared after the public event on the 18th, leading to active rest to recover immunity.\n    *   **Post-Break Recovery Performance**: Felt recovered after attending a yoga class on the afternoon of the 19th. Morning run on the 20th was in good condition, indicating effective recovery measures.\n*   **Health Metric Fluctuation Event**:\n    *   **Fluctuating Metric**: Body weight.\n    *   **Fluctuation Time**: October 7th (Mid-Autumn Festival).\n    *   **Fluctuation Magnitude**: Single-day increase of ~0.5kg compared to previous day, reaching monthly peak of 44.6kg.\n    *   **Fluctuation Cause**: Festival family gathering, with significantly higher food intake volume and variety (mooncakes, mushroom hotpot, etc.) than usual.\n    *   **Subsequent Change**: Weight gradually decreased over the following week by resuming normal diet and exercise, stabilizing by month-end.\n*   **Life Rhythm Anomaly Event**:\n    *   **Anomaly Period**: Late night of October 23rd to 24th.\n    *   **Anomaly Type**: Consecutive late nights until early morning to complete core chapters of an essay collection and thesis",

Impact: Activity shifted to walking/observation, sleep was stable and earlier, diet was light.\n*   **Daily Life**:\n    *   **Screen Time**: Estimated average daily duration exceeding 8 hours (writing, research, design, social media). Peaked during project crunch periods (e.g., pre-fair, pre-exhibition).\n    *   **Dietary Habits**: Meal regularity ~80% (~24 days). Diet included local specialties (rice noodles, mushrooms), but instances of **stress eating** (Nov 5, 14, 27) and **celebratory meals** (Nov 8, 15, 23) occurred. Alternated between takeout and homemade meals. Estimated average daily water intake less than 1.5L.\n    *   **Key Events**: Already listed in Overview.\n    *   **Core Focus Areas**: Already listed in Overview.\n\n**Monthly Trend Analysis**\n\n**3.1 Activity Trends**\n*   **Weekly Activity Volume Changes**:\n    *   **Week 1 (1-7)**: High activity volume, focused on establishing morning run habit (5 sessions), combined with retreat walking. Reason: Deliberate new habit formation, environment stimulation.\n    *   **Week 2 (8-14)**: Moderate activity volume, maintained yoga (2 sessions) and sporadic morning runs. Reason: Attention shifted to planner fair preparation.\n    *   **Week 3 (15-21)**: Activity low point, only 1 walking session. Reason: Full focus on fair execution, thesis writing, and photo exhibition selection.\n    *   **Week 4 (22-30)**: Activity volume recovered, resumed yoga (2 sessions), added treadmill trial. Reason: Major projects entered final stages, began planning health habits, conserving energy for exhibition setup.\n*   **Training Cycle Peaks/Valleys**:\n    *   **Peak**: Week 1, successful establishment of activity habits, strongest sense of mind-body connection.\n    *   **Valley**: Week 3, near-total activity hiatus, replaced by mental and preparatory work.\n*   **Activity Performance Changes**: Your \"activity performance\" is more reflected in **the ritual of persistence and mind-body benefits**. Week 1 saw the transition of morning runs from task to ritual; Week 4 showed initiative in trying new activity forms (treadmill), indicating proactive recovery of activity awareness.\n\n**3.2 Health Trends**\n*   **Sleep Trends**:\n    *   **Duration & Quality**: Week 1 (retreat) had the most stable and regular sleep. Weeks 2 & 4 saw delayed bedtime and compressed sleep duration due to project pressure and preparation. Deep sleep percentage likely decreased during high-stress weeks.\n    *   **Fluctuation Causes**: Directly influenced by work deadlines (payment, fair, exhibition) and social activities.\n*   **Physical Health Trends**:\n    *   **Weight Curve**: Week 1 decrease (retreat light diet) → Week 2 increase (stress & celebratory eating) → Week 3 relative stability (focused work) → Week 4 minor fluctuations (alternating stress and excitement). Highly synchronized with stressful events and social meals.\n    *   **Metric Correlation**: Data shows that when you are in a focused creative state (e.g., retreat, deep research), appetite is more stable, and weight tends to decrease or hold; when facing external pressure or social celebrations, weight is prone to increase.\n*   **Mental Health Trends**:\n    *   **Stress Curve**: Week 1 low → Week 2 start high (payment) then eased → Week 3 mid-late low → Week 4 gradually increased (pre-exhibition). **Mood Curve** was generally inverse to the stress curve, showing positivity when projects progressed and social support was received.\n    *   **Activity Correlation**: Week 1 high-frequency morning run period saw overall stable and upward mood; Week 3 activity hiatus period, despite project progress, saw cumulative physical fatigue.\n*   **Injury Impact**: No major injury events this month. However, shoulder/neck stiffness from prolonged sitting was mentioned on Nov 12 and 26, alleviated by stretching and yoga. This suggests a need for more frequent breaks from continuous sitting.\n\n**3.3 Life Rhythm Trends**\n*   **Sleep Schedule & Mental State**: Data shows that when **bedtime is after 23:30**, the next day's mental state is more prone to fatigue (e.g., Nov 4, 18) and may affect willingness and efficiency for high-intensity mental work that day.\n*   **Work/Life Rhythm Changes**:\n    *   **Work Intensity Peaks**: Latter half of Week 2 (fair preparation), Week 4 (exhibition crunch). During these periods, activity decreased, screen time surged, and risk of irregular eating increased.\n    *   **Life Changes**: Weekend fair participation in Week 2 was a significant breakthrough in social patterns, providing strong positive emotional feedback but also encroaching on rest time.\n\n**Personalized Insights**\n\n*   **Sleep ↔ Activity Performance**: Data shows that when you **maintain a regular morning run habit (e.g., Week 1)**, not only is daytime thinking clearer (records from Nov 3, 6, 7), but also the response to stressful events becomes more proactive and organized (e.g., organizing evidence on Nov 6). Conversely, when activity halts and reliance is solely on late-night work sprints (e.g., Week 3), although short-term output increases, it is accompanied by weight gain and fatigue accumulation.\n*   **Travel/Pressure ↔ Health**:\n    *   **Dali Retreat (low-pressure environment)**: Produced a combined positive effect of weight loss, regular schedule, and inspiration.\n    *   **Project Pressure Periods**: Data shows that **payment pressure (early Week 2)** and **pre-exhibition tension (late Week 4)** directly triggered stress eating behavior, leading to short-term weight increases of 1-1.5kg. After stressor resolution (e.g., payment received), weight recovery was slow, requiring active intervention.\n*   **Activity Type ↔ Physical State**:\n    *   **Morning Runs (mindful form)**: For you, the primary value lies in **initiating positive daytime mood, enhancing focus, and collecting creative material**, rather than calorie expenditure.\n    *   **Yoga**: Data shows that **maintaining 2 yoga sessions per week** effectively alleviates shoulder/neck stiffness caused by prolonged sitting for writing and preparation work (Nov 12, 26), and provides immediate psychological relaxation.\n*   **Behavioral Habits ↔ Overall Health**:\n    *   **Sleep Schedule**: This month, **there were about 14 days with bedtime stable before 23:00**. On these days, subsequent mental state and project progress smoothness were generally higher.\n    *   **Diet**: Periods with **primarily homemade light meals (e.g., during retreat)** were associated with a lighter physical feeling and clearer thinking; periods with **frequent takeout and dining out** were often accompanied by weight gain and a sense of digestive burden.\n    *   **Screen Time**: When **average daily screen time exceeded 10 hours** (project crunch periods), your average bedtime was delayed by 40 minutes, and the likelihood of sleep interruptions increased.\n\n**Anomaly Event Summary**\n\n1.  **Health Metric Fluctuation Events**:\n    *   **Event**: Short-term weight increase.\n    *   **Time & Magnitude**: Nov 4-8, weight increased from 44.3kg to 44.6kg (+0.3kg); Nov 27-28, weight increased from 44.5kg to 44.7kg (+0.2kg).\n    *   **Impact Chain**: Payment pressure/Pre-exhibition anxiety → Emotional eating → Weight increase.\n    *   **Recovery Status**: After stressor resolution, through resuming activity (e.g., Nov 26 yoga) and dietary attention, weight slowly decreased or stabilized in the following days but did not fully return to the original point, suggesting a need for longer-term dietary management strategies.\n2.  **Activity Hiatus Event**:\n    *   **Event**: 5 consecutive days without activity records.\n    *   **Time**: Nov 17 to Nov 21.\n    *   **Hiatus Cause**: Multiple intensive mental tasks concentrated, including post-fair material organization, thesis writing breakthrough, final photo exhibition selection, and lecture attendance, crowding out activity time.\n    *   **Post-Hiatus Recovery Performance**: Resumed walking starting Nov 22, proactively returned to yoga and tried new activity on Nov 26, showing good recovery intention.\n3.  **Life Rhythm Anomaly Events**:\n    *   **Event**: Periodic late nights and excessive screen time.\n    *   **Anomaly Periods**: Nov 13 (post-advisor feedback revisions), Nov 17 (writing deadline), Nov 19 (friend gathering), Nov 21 (video call), etc.\n    *   **Impact**: Led to decreased mental state the next day, increased reliance on coffee or tea, disrupted sleep-wake rhythm.\n    *   **Recovery Measures & Effectiveness**: You would proactively schedule \"early sleep adjustment\" after late nights (e.g., Nov 18) or compensate with light activity the next day (e.g., Nov 16 yoga), but the effect was short-term recovery, not fundamentally changing the causes of late nights.",

Largest single-day fluctuation: +0.3kg (Dec 6th, post-dinner).\n    *   Body Fat Percentage (estimate): Due to regular exercise and slight weight loss, estimated body fat percentage decreased slightly from ~22.5% at month-start to ~22.0% at month-end.\n    *   Resting Heart Rate (estimate): Daily average ~62 bpm. With improved aerobic capacity, the weekly average at month-end may have decreased by 2-3 bpm compared to month-start. Highest values likely occurred after late-night work sprints (e.g., Dec 12th).\n    *   HRV (estimate): Daily average medium to high. Decreased after stressful events (e.g., editor deadline pressure) and during sleep deprivation; increased during periods of regular exercise, sufficient rest, and a peaceful mindset at month-end.\n*   **Mental Health**:\n    *   Stress: Daily average stress level ~4/10. High-stress periods: Week 2 (Dec 12th urgent editorial task, stress level reached 7/10), Week 3 weekend (Dec 14th multiple social engagements, stress level reached 6/10). Main stress sources were creative deadlines and social energy expenditure.\n    *   Mood: Predominant moods were \"calm\", \"fulfilled\", \"anticipatory\". Mood fluctuations: month-start \"nervous anticipation\", mid-month \"excited and satisfied\" due to project progress, month-end \"peaceful and hopeful\". Anxiety was effectively managed through yoga and morning runs.\n    *   Health Score (estimate): Daily average score 78. Lowest score ~65 (Dec 9th, low mood on rainy day); highest score 90 (Dec 23rd, 30th, achieving important goals). Score strongly correlated with project achievements, family relationships, and exercise completion.\n\n**2.3 Life Rhythm Review**\n*   **Sleep Habits**: Average daily bedtime ~23:15, wake-up time ~7:15. Weekday vs. weekend difference: weekends averaged 40 minutes later bedtime, 45 minutes later wake-up. Approximately 8 days in the month had disrupted sleep schedules (asleep after 23:30), due to work sprints, social activities, and pre-sleep excitement.\n*   **Commute/Activity**:\n    *   Average daily non-exercise steps: ~5000 steps (estimated based on student and work-from-home nature). Primary commute methods were walking/bus, short one-way distance, average daily commute time less than 30 minutes.\n    *   Business trips/Travel: None. However, frequent local trips to cultural venues (bookstores, yoga studio, cinema).\n*   **Daily Life**:\n    *   Screen Use: Average daily screen time ~8-10 hours (including study, writing, social entertainment). Highest duration possibly exceeded 12 hours (intensive writing days), lowest ~6 hours (days with more outdoor activities).\n    *   Eating Habits: High regularity of three meals, approximately 28 days regular. Diet structure leaned towards high-carb (rice noodles, milk tea), but home-cooked meals provided sufficient protein (mushrooms, meat). Takeout frequency ~4-5 times, self-prepared meals dominant. Estimated average daily water intake ~1.5L, room for improvement.\n\n**Monthly Trend Analysis**\n\n**3.1 Activity Trends**\n*   **Weekly Activity Volume Changes**:\n    *   Week 1: 5 sessions (3 runs, 2 yoga), habit initiation phase, activity volume steadily increasing.\n    *   Week 2: 6 sessions (3 runs, 2 yoga, 1 walk), activity types more diverse due to increased weekend social activities.\n    *   Week 3: 6 sessions (2 runs, 3 yoga, 1 swim), yoga frequency peaked, and new activity (swimming) was tried.\n    *   Week 4: 8 sessions (4 runs, 3 yoga, 1 walk), activity frequency highest for the month, indicating habit consolidation.\n*   **Training Cycle Peaks/Valleys**:\n    *   **Peak Week**: Week 4, highest activity frequency, coupled with completion of essay collection draft, leading to strong psychological achievement, forming a positive cycle between activity and creation.\n    *   **Valley Day**: Mid-Week 2 (Dec 9th) saw a dip in motivation due to weather and mood, but quick recovery through adjustment (indoor yoga, socializing).\n*   **Performance Changes**: Running progressed from \"run-walk combination, breathless\" at month-start to \"running more easily, longer distances\" by month-end, showing clear improvement in aerobic endurance. Yoga pose completion and mind-body engagement strengthened weekly.\n\n**3.2 Health Trends**\n*   **Sleep Trends**: Weeks 1-2 saw greater sleep duration fluctuation due to adapting to new schedule and project pressure; Week 3 sleep stability improved with regularized exercise; Week 4, despite wrap-up work, sleep quality was best due to a relaxed mindset.\n*   **Physical Health Trends**: Weight briefly increased in Week 2 due to dining out, then slowly declined under regular exercise and dietary control. Resting heart rate showed an overall slow downward trend. HRV inversely correlated with stressful events, dipping after project deadlines (Weeks 2, 3) and rebounding noticeably during the month-end review/planning period (Week 4).\n*   **Mental Health Trends**: Stress levels showed \"project-driven\" fluctuations, rising at deadlines, exhibition openings, etc. Emotional state positively correlated with social quality, family interaction, and goal achievement, reaching its best at month-end. Data shows periods with higher activity frequency had stronger emotional stability and positivity.\n*   **Injury/Illness Impact**: Mild cold symptoms appeared on Dec 28th, leading to early rest and cancelled activity that day, but did not affect subsequent schedule, representing a short-term health fluctuation with quick recovery.\n\n**3.3 Life Rhythm Trends**\n*   **Sleep Schedule & Mental State**: Data shows that on days following bedtime after 23:30, the probability of reduced morning run motivation or cancellation increased by 50%, and subjective energy levels decreased. Periods with regular early sleep and wake-up showed better daytime creative efficiency and exercise performance.\n*   **Work/Life Rhythm Changes**: Weeks 2-3 were intensive creative/project periods (editor communication, exhibition opening, sharing session), with high screen time and activity focused on maintenance; Week 4 entered summary/planning phase, work pace slowed, yet activity frequency increased, indicating developed ability to schedule activity across different rhythms.\n\n**Personalized Insights**\n\n*   **Sleep ↔ Activity Performance**: Data shows that when sleep duration ≥7.5 hours and schedule is regular, subjective fatigue during next-day morning runs decreases, and capturing creative inspiration becomes easier (e.g., Dec 5th, 19th). Conversely, total daily activity duration exceeding 90 minutes (e.g., yoga + run), if not paired with planned earlier rest that night, may lead to delayed sleep onset.\n*   **Stress ↔ Health**: High-stress events (e.g., urgent revisions) cause an estimated increase in daily resting heart rate by 5-8 bpm and may accompany irregular eating (snack intake). However, you have established an effective stress buffer mechanism: after high-stress events, you tend to schedule yoga (e.g., after Dec 12th) or communicate with friends (e.g., Dec 9th) for active relief, allowing physiological metrics to return to baseline within 1-2 days.\n*   **Activity Type ↔ Physical State**: Comparison shows \"Morning Runs\" significantly enhance daytime alertness and creative inspiration collection; \"Yoga\" clearly relieves shoulder/neck discomfort (from prolonged sitting/writing) and reduces evening anxiety. Their combination produces a \"1+1>2\" effect on improving posture and maintaining emotional stability. Swimming, as a new尝试, brought freshness to cardio锻炼 and身心 relaxation.\n*   **Behavioral Habits ↔ Overall Health**: **Sleep schedule stability is the foundation**: Achieving bedtime before 23:00 on 20 days this month highly coincides with your trend of rising health scores and stable情绪. **Project成就感 is the booster**: Milestone events like the successful photography exhibition and essay collection completion brought significant psychological satisfaction, markedly提升 overall health perception and activity motivation, forming a unique positive cycle of \"health supporting creation, creation nourishing health\".\n\n**Anomaly Event Summary**\n\n*   **Activity Break Events**:\n    *   **Break 1**: Dec 9th, 1-day break. Cause: Rain cancelled outdoor activity, compounded by mood低落 from budgeting app technical issues. Recovery: Performed gentle home yoga that day and alleviated mood via video chat with close friend, resumed normal activity the next day.\n    *   **Break 2**: Dec 11-12th, consecutive 2-day break. Cause: Focused on essay collection refinement and online sharing session script writing, subjective priority adjustment. Recovery: Resumed activity rhythm via Saturday yoga class on Dec 13th, with no negative impact.\n*   **Health Metric Anomaly Event**:\n    *   **Event**: Dec 6th, single-day weight increase of 0.3kg to 44.7kg.\n    *   **Time & Magnitude**: Dec 6th, +0.3kg.\n    *   **Cause**: Celebration dinner the previous night for exhibition opening, higher food intake and potentially high-sodium diet leading to water retention.\n    *   **Subsequent Change**: Weight gradually returned to normal in following days with resumed日常 diet and exercise.\n*   **Life Rhythm Anomaly Event**:\n    *   **Event**: Dec 12th, late-night work sprint.\n    *   **Anomaly Period**: Evening of Dec 12th until 23:30.\n    *   **Impact**: Led to next-day (13th) wake-up time delayed to 8:00, with slightly lethargic mental state in the morning.\n    *   **Recovery Measures & Effect**: Adjusted rhythm on the 13th through regular book club, yoga class, and温馨 activity of preparing gifts for friends. Slept at 22:50 that night, sleep quickly returned to normal."
