This suggests that true 'spiritual illumination' can exist independently of a specific physical light source, arising from inner focus and a thirst for knowledge. In this way, the passage not only echoes the 'light' introduced at the beginning but also elevates the theme to a more intrinsic level."

For instance, instead of saying \"I felt the weight of time,\" one might describe \"the scent of paper, ink, and fine dust slowly filling the nostrils.\" In this way, objective details carry subjective experiences, enabling readers to perceive and connect with the text more powerfully."

This first step is truly remarkable. Regarding the wandering thoughts you mentioned, please rest assured completely. This is not only normal but also one of the most fundamental experiences that almost everyone encounters in mindfulness meditation practice. The process of thoughts drifting away, then you becoming aware of them, and gently bringing your focus back to your breath—this very process is the practice of mindfulness itself, not a failure in practice. So, you've already done an excellent job."

Start from your toes and gradually shift your attention to different parts of your body, simply noticing the sensations there—whether they are warm, tense, or relaxed—without judgment. This method provides a more concrete 'path' to follow and may be easier for beginners to grasp than focusing solely on the breath. Additionally, regarding your mention of thoughts drifting to prose or music, this actually indicates that your process is well-structured and your mind and body have already entered a state of relaxation. You can try saying to yourself at the beginning of your meditation: 'For now, I’ll leave prose and music outside the door. For the next 10 minutes, I’ll only be with my breath/body.' This serves as a gentle, ritualistic declaration."

The key to effectiveness lies not in the duration of a single session but in consistent regularity. Even if it's only 5 minutes a day, maintaining it steadily offers far greater benefits than meditating for 30 minutes in a single intense session.

Regarding guided audio, it is very helpful for establishing habits and providing structure in the early stages. It acts like a gentle guide, softly reminding you to return with sound when your thoughts drift away. You can try some beginner-guided audio focusing on breath or body scans, as many apps or podcasts offer free resources. When using audio, remember to focus your attention primarily on the guidance and your own sensations, rather than judging the quality of the audio."

Set the shooting mode to 'Aperture Priority' (A mode), which allows you to control the depth of field to highlight people or details in the old streets. 2. Set the focus area to 'Wide' and the focus mode to 'AF-C' (Continuous Autofocus), making it easier to capture dynamic street moments. 3. Enable the 'Product Showcase Setting' function. Although it is often used for live streaming, turning it on will make face detection more responsive. These settings will help you get started quickly."

When cleaning, first use a blower to remove dust, then gently wipe with a dedicated lens pen or soft cloth, avoiding direct use of clothing or paper towels. Additionally, the ZV-E10 can connect to a smartphone via the 'Imaging Edge Mobile' app, making photo transfer very convenient. You can download it in advance."

Using the camera to observe light, shadow, and textures is itself a form of storytelling, which aligns with the \"detailed narrative\" emphasized in your course. Once you become familiar with the equipment, take this observational approach to the old streets and capture those moments that carry a sense of story."

When using a kenzan, ensure the cut of the flower stem is a fresh diagonal surface. Avoid inserting at the base of the kenzan's pins; instead, choose an area with dense pins and insert at an angle. This increases the contact area, providing greater stability. Additionally, after insertion, gently wiggle the stem left and right to feel whether it has 'gripped' the force. Maintaining a calm mind and steady hands is also crucial, as this is inherently part of the meditative practice in the Ikenobo school."

She attached screenshots as evidence and received advice on organizing the evidence. 2. That same afternoon at a bookstore, she sought support and advice from fellow writer Song Wen, receiving suggestions on deadlines for reminders, record-keeping, and links to complaint platforms. 3. On the afternoon of November 6, she systematically compiled a package of evidence for her rights protection. She organized all evidence into a clear PDF document following a logical chain and drafted a formal reminder letter, outlining a plan to file a complaint if no resolution was reached by the following Monday. 4. On the morning of November 7, she finalized the content of the reminder letter and the evidence PDF, ensuring the tone was professional, clear, and assertive. She demanded payment of the manuscript fee within seven working days and formally sent the documents via email. Ultimately, on the morning of November 10, she received an apology email from the \"Prism\" platform's finance department and a bank deposit notification (the 1,500 yuan manuscript fee), and the editor also sent an apology via WeChat.",

Among the four sample dates provided, she only actually engaged in morning brisk walking on June 1. On June 4, the activity was canceled due to sultry weather and physical discomfort (mild headache, stiff shoulders and neck), and was replaced with indoor stretching. There was no record of morning exercise on June 6, as she attempted cycling in the evening that day. On June 14, morning brisk walking was canceled due to stress from the previous day and was substituted with light indoor yoga. Therefore, her morning exercise was prone to last-minute cancellations influenced by factors such as weather (sultriness), mood (stress), and physical condition (fatigue, discomfort), and was not a fixed daily commitment.",
