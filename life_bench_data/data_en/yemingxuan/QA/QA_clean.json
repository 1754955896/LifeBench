The development process was as follows: drawing on his existing 3D printing skills (having successfully designed and printed a flower stand connector), he conceptualized the design during a walk, sketched it out, and researched materials to verify feasibility. Subsequently, he systematically planned the development steps (such as modeling that evening, sending the model to a colleague for analysis the next day, and conducting tests over the weekend) and discussed the idea with his colleague Li Xiang, receiving suggestions on using TPU material and performing static analysis.",
