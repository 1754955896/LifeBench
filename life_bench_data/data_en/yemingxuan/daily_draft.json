In addition to continuing traction and electrotherapy to alleviate symptoms, the therapist focused on guiding him through the most fundamental core muscle activation exercises, such as precise diaphragmatic breathing and static glute bridges (with the hips slightly lifted off the bed). The therapist repeatedly emphasized the accuracy and control of the movements, instructing him to consciously feel the subtle contractions of the abdominal and gluteal muscles while avoiding the use of the lower back to exert force, which is crucial for preventing secondary injuries. Ye Mingxuan learned attentively, but he found these seemingly simple exercises to be quite challenging."

The father and son moved the radio to the well-lit dining table in the living room with tacit understanding. Ye Jianguo began disassembling the outer casing and, as he had once done when mentoring apprentices at the factory, explained the internal structure and working principles of this vintage radio to Ye Mingxuan.

Using old wooden boards and a secondhand iron rack, he measured, cut, and secured the materials with his father's assistance, constructing a sturdy tiered plant stand. Finally, they repotted or rearranged the organized succulents, instantly transforming the balcony into a neat, orderly, and vibrant space."

During a rest stop along the way, Wu Bin magically produced a small custom-made birthday cake ordered in advance in Xining and a packaged custom car fragrance gift from a thermal box. Against the backdrop of the blue sky, white clouds, and rolling mountains of the plateau, they celebrated Ye Mingxuan’s birthday with a touch of wilderness and heartfelt sincerity. In the evening, the two arrived in Gangcha County, where they enjoyed dinner at a cozy Tibetan-style restaurant. They toasted with butter tea instead of wine, exchanged blessings, and spent a simple, natural, yet memorable birthday."
