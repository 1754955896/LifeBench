She decided to sow the seeds in two batches: the first batch (mid-March) would include trellised vegetables such as tomatoes, cucumbers, and beans, while the second batch (early April) would consist of leafy greens like bok choy and cilantro. While sorting through the tomato and bean seeds left over from the previous year, she realized she did not have enough cucumber seeds, so she added \"purchase cucumber and cilantro seeds\" to her shopping list."

However, the vegetables inside still wilted quickly, and the machine emitted a louder humming noise than usual during operation. She called her husband over to inspect it together. Ma Zhiqiang touched the side of the refrigerator and remarked that it was heating up noticeably. The couple then compared their electricity bills from the past few months and discovered a gradual upward trend in consumption. Considering that the refrigerator was a large appliance running year-round, and that repairs would be neither cost-effective nor energy-efficient, they discussed the matter and tentatively decided to adopt a more frugal approach. Starting from the next month, they would begin saving money, aiming to replace the old refrigerator with a new energy-efficient model before the peak electricity consumption period in summer."

She went to her small courtyard and began mimicking a few movements from memory. Though her movements were not entirely accurate, the slow stretches and deep breaths made her feel noticeably more relaxed in her shoulders and neck. She planned to continue tomorrow and, if she felt good, to stick with it."

She gave the fence a push, and it wobbled significantly. \"This is too dangerous,\" she thought with a start. \"Mingzhe and Yuxin often play around here. If they bump into it or if the fence collapses, it could be serious.\" She immediately decided that she must discuss repairs with her husband when he returned home in the evening."

Ultimately, considering the high cost of hospitalization and the significant time required for accompanying care (Ma Zhiqiang found it difficult to take long-term leave, while Ma Xiulan had to care for their three children), they tentatively leaned toward first attempting intensive treatment and care at home. However, they emphasized the need to strictly follow the doctor’s instructions and remain prepared for the possibility of hospitalization at any time. They also made preliminary plans for covering medical expenses (using savings first, and if insufficient, temporarily borrowing from relatives) and assigned responsibilities for taking care of their father."

Without much hesitation, she signed up for the online course via the provided link, planning to follow along in her spare time."

She merely imitated the general form, with the main goal of understanding what the movements were like. After completing the two movements, she stopped, feeling slightly warm and finding the experience quite novel."

Thinking of her father, who had just recovered from a serious illness and had weakened immunity, as well as her three school-going children who were prone to cross-infection, she immediately took it seriously. She called the Jingwen Road Community Health Service Center to inquire in detail about the vaccination schedule, eligible groups, and costs, and specifically asked whether her father, who had a history of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), was suitable for vaccination. After receiving an affirmative response from the doctor, she decisively scheduled appointments to take her youngest daughter for vaccination on Friday afternoon this week and her father next Monday."

After nearly an hour of discussion, compromise, and negotiation, they finally reached an agreement: On weekends at home, Ma Mingxuan would be allowed a total of two hours of free mobile phone usage per day (excluding contacting family members and checking study materials), provided that he completes all his homework for the day and takes on assigned household chores (such as taking out the trash and looking after his younger sister). Additionally, the phone must not be taken into the bedroom and must be handed over to his parents for safekeeping after 9:30 p.m. This rule would be implemented on a trial basis for two weeks. Ma Mingxuan reluctantly but ultimately agreed. Although Ma Xiulan felt that two hours was still too much, she accepted the outcome of this \"democratic negotiation.\" However, she still felt stiffness in her shoulders and neck from the prolonged and tense discussion."

Forty minutes later, after rinsing it off, she looked at her reflection—her hair now jet black, making her appear much more spirited—and let out a soft sigh of relief, a faint, satisfied smile gracing her lips. This was not merely about covering the gray hairs; it felt more like a small, proactive response to her busy life and the gradually passing years."

After the meeting, Ma Xiulan approached Ms. Han for a one-on-one conversation. Ms. Han presented the report card, acknowledging Mingxuan's strong performance in mathematics and logic. However, she clearly pointed out that his reading comprehension and composition in Chinese were significant weaknesses, lagging far behind his other subjects. She provided specific examples of issues frequently appearing in his compositions, such as incoherent sentences and dry descriptions. Ms. Han suggested that during the winter break, he must read and practice more, as relying solely on textbooks would not suffice. Ma Xiulan carefully noted down each of the teacher's suggestions in her notebook. While feeling somewhat anxious, she was more focused on clarifying the direction for improvement."

She then placed it, along with the sample orders she had previously made for the community, some harmoniously color-matched fabric scraps, and embroidery threads, into a dedicated cloth bag to take to the community the next day. Next, she tidied up the scattered tools on the table—returning the embroidery needles to their needle case, rolling up the threads by color and putting them back in their places, and neatly folding the fabric scraps. The living room quickly regained its usual tidiness, yet the air seemed to retain a lingering sense of tranquility and fulfillment brought about by the creative process."
