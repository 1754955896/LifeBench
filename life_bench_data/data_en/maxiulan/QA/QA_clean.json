She scheduled noisy chores like laundry for times when the children were at school or taking naps, checked the windows for proper sealing, and drew the curtains. She also informed her second son’s homeroom teacher about the plan during their communication. After dinner, she urged the children to wash up early and arranged for the whole family to turn off the lights half an hour earlier than usual. The television was kept at an extremely low volume. To provide direct support, she prepared a carefully crafted breakfast (fried eggs, warm milk, and toasted bread slices) and a lunchbox (tomato and egg stir-fry, green pepper and shredded pork with rice) for her eldest son on the morning of the first day of the high school entrance exam. She hung a hand-drawn encouraging slogan at the entrance of the study. During dinner, she specifically served the nutritious fish belly to her eldest son and avoided discussing exam-related topics. In the evening, she arranged for him to soak his feet in hot water to relieve fatigue.",
