    *   **Week 2:** **Establishment phase** for habits. Baduanjin regularized (3 times), walking initiated (2 times). Exercise volume increased ~150% compared to previous week.
    *   **Week 3:** **Consolidation and integration phase** for exercise. Baduanjin maintained, walking regularly executed, plus high-intensity labor like community work and garden tilling added. Exercise volume peaked.
    *   **Week 4:** **Stable application phase** for exercise. Structured exercise habits solidified and applied to skill learning (e.g., following exercise videos). Exercise volume remained high, types more diverse.
*   **Training Cycle Peaks/Lows:**
    *   **Peak Week: Week 3.** Most diverse exercise types (Baduanjin, walking, community work, gardening), highest total physical activity, highest sense of achievement from integrating exercise into life.
    *   **Low Days: Individual days in Week 1 (e.g., March 2nd, 4th).** Structured exercise interrupted due to weather or obligations, but housework continued.
*   **Exercise Performance Changes:** Baduanjin performance continuously improved, from awkward movements to skilled independence. Walking evolved from a social activity to incorporate deeper spousal communication, enhancing emotional value. Exercise performance positively correlated with **sleep quality and mood**.

#### **3.2 Health Trends**
*   **Sleep Trends:**
    *   **Duration & Quality:** Fluctuations and later bedtimes in Weeks 1 & 2 due to anxiety and learning excitement; in Weeks 3 & 4, as regular exercise habits solidified, **self-reported sleep depth and soundness improved**, despite continued bedtime fluctuations.
    *   **Fluctuation Causes:** Later bedtimes primarily caused by **psychological factors (anxiety, excitement)** and **social activities**.
*   **Physical Health Trends:**
    *   **Weight:** Showed a "rise-stabilize-fall" trend. Increased in Week 2 due to gatherings, stabilized in Week 3, **steadily declined** in Week 4 with continued exercise and labor.
    *   **Correlation Analysis:** In Week 4, regular exercise combined with spring planting labor led to noticeable weight loss alongside self-reported充沛 energy, indicating the effectiveness of **combining exercise with productive labor** for health management.
*   **Mental Health Trends:**
    *   **Stress & Mood:** Stress levels low at month start and end, with small peaks mid-month due to specific events (parent-teacher meeting, pact execution).

#### **3.3 Life Rhythm Trends**
*   **Sleep Schedule & Mental State:** On **days with bedtime after 23:30**, morning exercise state the next day might be slightly compromised, or it might take longer to enter an efficient housework state during the day. On days with regular early sleep/wake times, energy levels were more balanced throughout the day.

### **Module 4: Personalized Insights**

*   **Sleep ↔ Exercise Performance:**
    *   Data shows that when you **had sufficient sleep the previous night (e.g., >7 hours) and felt you slept soundly**, your focus during morning Baduanjin the next day and the sense of well-being afterward were stronger. For example, after morning practice on March 24th and 31st, you described feeling "refreshed and clear-headed".
    *   The reverse correlation also exists: when **performing over 2 hours of moderate-to-high intensity physical labor in a single day (e.g., spring planting on March 25th)**, increased physical fatigue may prompt earlier sleepiness and higher sleep demand that night.
*   **Learning/Stress ↔ Health:**
    *   **Learning a new skill (smartphone)** initially (March 20-22) brought significant excitement and a sense of accomplishment, boosting your mental health score. However, it also caused a **sudden increase in screen time and delayed sleep schedule**, creating short-term disruption. Yet, the convenience and confidence gained after mastery (e.g., successful payment on March 28th) offered long-term health benefits far outweighing the short-term cost.
    *   **Family-related stress** (e.g., finances, education) had an immediate impact on your sleep and mood. However, data shows that by **communicating with your spouse (family meetings), transforming anxiety into concrete action plans (establishing the pact)**, you effectively managed the stress without letting it cause long-term interruption to your exercise habits.
*   **Exercise Type ↔ Physical State:**
    *   **Baduanjin** is directly associated with **relief from shoulder/neck stiffness** and **morning emotional calmness**. As a low-intensity mind-body practice, it is suitable as a ritual to start the day.
    *   **Regular walking** (especially social walks with others) shows significant effects on relieving **daytime fatigue** and **improving perceived nighttime sleep quality**. It is not only exercise but also an important moment for **social and emotional support**.
    *   **Productive labor (gardening)** combines exercise with long-term family goals (maintaining the courtyard), providing unique **feelings of accomplishment and satisfaction**. This psychological benefit strengthens your intrinsic motivation to maintain physical activity.
*   **Behavioral Habits ↔ Overall Health:**
    *   **A stable family life rhythm and harmonious family relationships** are the foundation of your health improvement this month. The establishment and execution of the "Study Support Pact" created a supportive family environment, indirectly supporting your personal health plan.
    *   **Integrating health habits (Baduanjin, walking) with existing social connections (walking with neighbors) or interests (gardening
