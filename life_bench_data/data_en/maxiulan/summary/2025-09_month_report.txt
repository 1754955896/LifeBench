Your Monthly Summary is as follows:

**Monthly Overview**

*   **Basic Information**: 41-year-old female, homemaker/part-time gig worker.
*   **Total Physical Activity**:
    *   **Functional Activity** (Housework/Gardening/Daily Errands): 30 sessions / ~2100 minutes / Distance not precisely trackable (primarily steps and labor duration).
    *   **Caregiving Activity** (Hospital Accompanying & Home Rehabilitation Care): 16 sessions / ~1920 minutes / Primarily standing, walking, and assisting movements.
    *   **Intentional Exercise** (Walking): 6 sessions / ~140 minutes / Estimated distance 7 km.
    *   **Total Monthly Activity**: 52 sessions / ~4160 minutes. Your "exercise" primarily consists of high-intensity labor maintaining household operations and caregiving responsibilities, far exceeding typical daily activity levels.
*   **Health Status Summary**:
    *   **Health Score**: No quantitative score, but subjective health perception followed a "V" curve, hitting a low point mid-month due to stress and fatigue, then gradually recovering towards month-end.
    *   **Core Tags**: "Physical exhaustion under high pressure and heavy burden" and "Health awareness triggered by crisis".
    *   **Overall Health Rating**: **Needs Improvement**. This month involved severe physical and mental depletion. While no major illness occurred, multiple indicators show the body is in a state of stress and recovery.
*   **Key Events**:
    *   **Health Metric Shift/Major Life Change**: Sep 10-17, father hospitalized due to acute COPD exacerbation. You provided primary daytime care, completely disrupting your routine, leading to weight loss, sleep deprivation, and a sharp increase in stress.
    *   **Health Metric Shift**: Sep 11, while caregiving, father's condition triggered your first conscious concern about your own cardiopulmonary health, marking the beginning of health management awareness.
    *   **Activity Milestone**: Starting Sep 21, after the high-stress period, you began and maintained evening walks as an active health regulation method.
*   **Goal Completion**: No specific quantitative exercise/health goals were set this month. The core goal was managing the family crisis (father's hospital care), which was achieved with his safe discharge on Sep 20.
*   **Core Changes vs. Last Month (Inferred from daily descriptions)**:
    *   **Activity Volume**: Added high-intensity "Caregiving Activity" (hospital care). Estimated daily physical exertion duration increased by ~200%. Activity intensity escalated from routine housework to near-caregiver level.
    *   **Health Metrics**: **Weight** decreased by 0.5 kg (from 53.8 kg at month-start to 53.3 kg at month-end), with a fluctuation range of 1.0 kg. **Sleep** duration and quality severely deteriorated mid-month (10th-18th), with average daily sleep under 5 hours. **Stress** levels surged from routine household pressure to multiple high pressures from caregiving and financial concerns.
    *   **Life Rhythm**: Routine became extremely disrupted. Nights with bedtime past midnight totaled 9 days, primarily due to hospital night shifts, handling backlogged tasks, and children's schoolwork. Screen time shifted from mainly entertainment to intensive medical information searches, family coordination, and online course study.
*   **Core Focus**: In the latter part of the month, your focus shifted from purely managing household affairs to **alertness about your own respiratory health** and restoring physical/mental balance through **regular walks and routine adjustment**.

    *   Weekly Frequency: High-intensity labor (housework or caregiving) daily, no fixed rest days.
    *   Daily High-Frequency Time Slots: **Morning (6:30-11:00)** for taking children to school, errands, hospital care, or rehabilitation care; **Evening (17:00-18:30)**, a newly added walking slot in the latter part of the month.
    *   Locations: Home (housework), Jinghai District Hospital (caregiving), Parents' home (rehabilitation care), Residential area & surrounding roads (walking).
    *   Consistency: Longest consecutive "activity" days (including all labor types): 30 days (no rest all month). However, after father's discharge, a more regular new rhythm of "rehabilitation care + evening walk" was established starting Sep 21.

**2.2 Health Review**
*   **Sleep**:
    *   Average Daily Sleep Duration: **~5.8 hours on weekdays**, **~6.5 hours on weekends**. Monthly average ~6.0 hours, significantly below recommended levels.
    *   Sleep Stage Distribution: No device data. Based on descriptions, deep sleep percentage was extremely low mid-month (10th-18th), with light, easily interrupted sleep.
    *   Bedtime/Wake-up Time Stability: Highly variable. **Bedtime** ranged from 21:30 to 01:15 next day; **Wake-up time** ranged from 05:40 to 06:50. Most stable period was the last week (24th-30th), with bedtime between 23:30-23:50 and wake-up between 06:10-06:20.
    *   Average Daily Sleep Interruptions: Frequent nighttime interruptions during mid-month caregiving period (≥3 times), recovering to 1-2 times by month-end.
*   **Physiological Metrics**:
    *   **Weight**: Start-of-month 53.8 kg, end-of-month 53.3 kg, overall decrease of 0.5 kg. Weekly averages: Week 1 53.7 kg, Week 2 53.1 kg (lowest), Week 3 53.0 kg, Week 4 53.3 kg. Largest fluctuations occurred Sep 6-7 (increased to 53.9 kg after gathering) and Sep 10-14 (decreased to 53.0 kg during caregiving).
    *   **Body Fat Percentage**: No precise data, but weight loss was primarily due to muscle and water loss, suggesting minimal change in body fat percentage.
    *   **Resting Heart Rate**: No device data. However, based on descriptions like "feeling short of breath, dizzy," subjective feeling suggests resting heart rate may have been elevated during the high-stress fatigue period (Sep 10-18).
    *   **HRV (Heart Rate Variability)**: No device data. Inferred to be at lower levels due to prolonged stress and sleep deprivation.
*   **Mental Health**:
    *   **Stress**: Daily average stress showed a bimodal distribution. **High-stress period was Sep 10-18**, estimated stress level 8-9/10 (10 max), stemming from father's condition, caregiving fatigue, financial worries, and children's schoolwork. Stress decreased to 4-5/10 by month-end.
    *   **Mood**: Primary mood tags shifted from **anxiety, exhaustion, worry** (mid-month) to **calm, relief, sense of accomplishment** (month-end). Mood fluctuations directly correlated with father's condition and family affairs progress.
    *   **Health Score**: No quantitative score, but subjective feeling score aligned with the stress curve, lowest mid-month, recovering by month-end.

**2.3 Life Rhythm Review**
*   **Routine Habits**:
    *   Average Daily Routine: **Weekdays** bedtime ~23:50, wake-up ~06:15; **Weekends** bedtime ~23:15, wake-up ~06:30. Difference mainly due to slightly earlier bedtime on weekends.
    *   Days with Disrupted Routine: **Total 9 days** with bedtime past midnight (1st, 5th, 8th, 12th, 15th, 16th, 17th, 18th, 19th), all due to hospital care, handling orders, or tutoring children.
*   **Commute/Mobility**:
    *   Average Daily Non-exercise Steps: Estimated **~8000 steps daily**. Highest step week was during father's hospitalization (Week 2) due to frequent movement in hospital; lowest step weeks were during recovery periods at month start and end.
    *   Commute Methods: Primarily **walking** between home, hospital, parents' home, and market, with single-trip distances ranging 0.5-2 km. Average daily commute walking duration ~60-90 minutes.
    *   "Business Trips"/Travel: None. However, father's hospitalization can be considered a "high-intensity life event trip," decisively impacting activity (shifted to caregiving), sleep (severely deprived), and diet (irregular).
*   **Daily Life**:
    *   Screen Time: Average daily duration ~3-4 hours. Mix of work (coordinating affairs, information searches) and entertainment (watching shows, social media). Highest usage days were when handling craft orders and medical information (e.g., 5th, 11th).
    *   Eating Habits: Meal regularity ~70% (21 days), irregular days concentrated during hospital care period. Diet structure primarily homemade Chinese meals, high in carbohydrates. Very few takeout meals (≤2 times), homemade meals dominant. Average daily water intake insufficient, especially neglecting hydration when busy.

**Monthly Trend Analysis**

**3.1 Activity Trends**
*   **Weekly Activity Volume Changes**:
    *   **Week 1 (1st-7th)**: Activity primarily routine housework and gardening, stable duration, reduced activity on weekend gathering day.
    *   **Weeks 2-3 (8th-21st)**: Activity volume surged and transformed. Core was hospital caregiving (high-intensity care), intentional exercise paused. Total activity duration peaked, but all was passive consumption-type.
    *   **Week 4 (22nd-30th)**: Activity volume decreased from peak, structure optimized. Caregiving activity transitioned to regular rehabilitation care, and intentional walking was actively introduced. Total duration decreased but included restorative activity.
*   **Performance Peak/Valley Weeks**:
    *   **Performance Valley Week**: Week 2 (8th-14th), body in stress state, subjective feelings of "shortness of breath, dizziness, fatigue," representing peak physical and mental depletion.
    *   **Recovery & Adjustment Peak Week**: Week 4 (22nd-30th), successfully established new habit of "rehabilitation care + evening walk." Activity shifted from pure consumption to a balance of consumption and recovery, entering a recovery phase in physical/mental state.
*   **Activity Performance Change**: Intentional walking went from non-existent to trying (21st, 20 minutes) to regularized (24th, 30th, 30 minutes), demonstrating your willpower for active health management.

**3.2 Health Trends**
*   **Sleep Trends**:
    *   Weekly Change: Week 1 (average ~6.5 hours) → Weeks 2-3 (average ~5.0 hours, poor quality) → Week 4 (average ~6.8 hours, quality improved).
    *   Reason for Sleep Fluctuation: Entirely driven by father's hospitalization event. Sleep severely deprived in Weeks 2-3. With event resolution and active adjustment in Week 4, sleep duration and continuity significantly recovered.
*   **Physical Health Trends**:
    *   **Weight**: Showed a "decrease - bottom out - recover" trend. Rapid decrease of 1.0 kg in Week 2 due to stress, fatigue, and poor appetite; maintained low level in Week 3 under continued depletion; recovered 0.3 kg in Week 4 with routine normalization, gatherings, and improved mood.
    *   **Subjective Health Feelings**: Synchronized with weight trend. Symptoms like fatigue and shortness of breath were most severe mid-month, alleviated by month-end.
*   **Mental Health Trends**:
    *   **Stress & Mood**: Curve highly synchronized with sleep and weight. High stress (Weeks 2-3) accompanied by anxiety, exhaustion; stress alleviation (Week 4) accompanied by calm, satisfaction. Data shows **family crisis event was the core determinant of psychological state**.
*   **Injury/Illness Impact**: No exercise injuries, but **secondary health depletion** occurred. Sep 17-18, due to fatigue and hospital environment, cold symptoms appeared, leading to further energy decline, affecting caregiving quality and personal study plans, not alleviated until after the 19th.

**3.3 Life Rhythm Trends**
*   **Routine & Mental State**: Strong correlation. Days following bedtime past midnight were often described as "exhausted, anxious, low energy"; whereas days following stable routine at month-end (bedtime before 23:45) were described as "calm, focused, sense of accomplishment."
*   **Work/Life Rhythm Changes**: Life rhythm in Weeks 2-3 was completely dominated by the unexpected "hospital caregiving" event, interrupting personal study, craft work, and regular routine. In Week 4, through family meeting for task division and active planning, a new rhythm centered on "family rehabilitation management" was re-established, incorporating personal health activity (walking).

**Personalized Insights**

*   **Stress Event ↔ Physical Depletion**: Data shows **the high-pressure caregiving event (father's hospitalization) directly caused your weight to drop 1.0 kg within 1 week**, primarily due to combined effects of insufficient energy intake, sleep deprivation, and high physical exertion. Weight naturally recovered with routine normalization and emotional relief after the event subsided.
*   **Walking ↔ Psychological Recovery**: Data from the latter part of the month shows **your mood state was generally described as "relaxed," "calm," "pleasant" after 20-30 minute evening walks**. This highly aligns with the need for active recovery after high-intensity labor, making walking an effective psychological buffer for you.
*   **Routine Stability ↔ Family Management Efficacy**: End-of-month data shows **when your bedtime stabilized around 23:45, your efficiency and mindset in handling rehabilitation care, housework, and family coordination the next day were significantly better**. A stable routine is a crucial foundation for you, as the family's core manager, to maintain system operation.
*   **Health Awareness Awakening ↔ Behavioral Change**: The health awareness awakening on Sep 11 (concern about own breathing) was a key turning point this month. Data shows **after this event, although still under high pressure, you began actively seeking health information (learning caregiving), adjusting behavior (trying walks), ultimately forming a healthier life rhythm by month-end**. External crisis transformed into internal motivation for health management.

**Abnormal Event Summary**
