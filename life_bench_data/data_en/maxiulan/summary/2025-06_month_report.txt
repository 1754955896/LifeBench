### **Module 2: Monthly Review**

#### **2.1 Exercise Review**
*   **Exercise Overview:**
    *   Your main activity types this month were: morning walks, Baduanjin, housework, gardening, community mutual aid labor.
    *   Exercise intensity was primarily **low intensity (Z1) and moderate-low intensity (Z2)**, covering daily activities (Z1) and active exercise (Z2, e.g., Baduanjin, heavier housework). Estimated cumulative duration of Z2 and above intensity activities: ~600 minutes.
*   **Statistics & Best Performance by Activity:**
    *   **Morning Walks:** Total sessions 30, total duration 900 minutes, estimated total distance 67.5km. Single longest continuous duration 30 minutes, has become a solid daily ritual.
    *   **Baduanjin:** Total sessions 25, total duration 375 minutes, average 15 minutes per session. From initial attempt on June 6th to June 30th, you progressed to completing a coherent ~20-minute practice, showing significant improvement in proficiency.
    *   **Housework/Gardening:** Estimated equivalent moderate-low intensity exercise duration 1800 minutes. June 8th (Sunday seasonal deep clean) and June 26th-28th (helping neighbor organize garden) were days with higher labor intensity.
*   **Exercise Habit Preferences:**
    *   **High-Frequency Exercise Days:** Persisted with morning activity daily, no significant weekday/weekend differences, demonstrating strong habit adherence.
    *   **High-Frequency Time Slot:** Early morning 5:30-6:30, accounting for 100%. You effectively utilize the quiet time at the start of the day for health management.
    *   **Exercise Locations:** Jingwen Road vicinity (walks 30x), own courtyard (Baduanjin 25x, gardening), indoors (rainy day adjustment), neighbor's home (mutual aid labor).
    *   **Exercise Consistency:** Longest consecutive exercise days: 30 days (entire month), no breaks in morning activity. Main activity types flexibly adjusted based on weather and schedule, showing excellent adaptability.

#### **2.2 Health Review**
*   **Sleep:**
    *   **Average Daily Sleep Duration:** Estimated ~6.5 hours on weekdays, ~7 hours on weekends. Generally sufficient, but depth affected by stress events.
    *   **Sleep Schedule Stability:** Wake-up time stable between 5:30-6:10; bedtime varied significantly, between 22:00-00:30, a fluctuation of 150 minutes. Main reasons for staying up late: craft order rush (24th), late-night family discussions (18th, 19th), driving test study (29th).
    *   **Sleep Interruptions:** No record of frequent nighttime awakenings, but stress event (25th) likely caused difficulty falling asleep.
*   **Physiological Indicators:**
    *   **Weight:** 54.5kg at month start, 54.0kg at month end, a decrease of 0.5kg for the month. Weekly average gradually decreased from 54.7kg in week 1 to 54.1kg in week 4. Largest single-day fluctuation was +0.4kg (June 2nd, after holiday meal), but quickly corrected. Trend is a healthy, gentle decline.
    *   **Resting Heart Rate (Estimated):** No device data, but based on your self-report of "more energetic during the day" and "less prone to fatigue", it can be inferred that regular activity has improved cardiovascular function and physical recovery capacity.
*   **Mental Health:**
    *   **Stress:** Daily average stress level was low, but two distinct high-stress periods existed: 1) June 10th-22nd, prolonged focus and family rhythm adjustment due to eldest son's entrance exams; 2) June 25th-27th, intense worry and anxiety triggered by husband's traffic accident. Stressors clearly originated from the safety and major affairs of core family members.
    *   **Mood:** Predominant mood tags were "calm", "content", "warm". Emotional highs occurred during family gatherings (Children's Day, birthday, family gatherings) and personal achievement moments (order delivery, successful deposit). Emotional lows coincided with the aforementioned high-stress periods.
    *   **Health Score (Estimated):** Daily average score 7.5. Highest scores appeared on June 4th (order delivery) and June 15th (after family gathering), reaching 8.5. Lowest score appeared on June 25th (learning of accident), ~5.0.

#### **2.3 Life Rhythm Review**
*   **Sleep/Wake Habits:**
    *   **Average Daily Schedule:** Weekdays: sleep ~23:15, wake ~5:45; Weekends: sleep ~23:00, wake ~5:50. Minimal difference between weekends and weekdays.
    *   **Schedule Disruption:** 8 days in the month had sleep times later than 23:30, reasons included: holiday gatherings, excitement from order delivery, family financial discussions, craft order rush, driving test study.
*   **Commute/Activity:**
    *   **Non-Exercise Steps:** Based on your frequent shopping, neighbor visits, child pick-up/drop-off, community activity participation, estimated average daily non-exercise steps ~4000. Highest step week was week 2 (included multiple gatherings/activities), lowest was late week 4 (increased home affairs after accident).
    *   **Commute Mode:** Primary commute mode is walking, activity radius within community vicinity, single-trip distances mostly under 1km, average daily commute/outing duration ~1-2 hours.
*   **Daily Life:**
    *   **Screen Time:** Average daily screen time ~3 hours, primarily used for socializing (WeChat), information browsing (life, health knowledge), and late-month driving test study. Entertainment (TV watching) mostly in evenings, but consciously reduced during exam period.
    *   **Dietary Habits:** Three meals extremely regular, self-prepared meals dominant, takeout meals very infrequent (inferred <5 times for the month). Diet structure centered on home-cooked meals, rich in vegetables (homegrown), with moderate dining out for holidays/birthdays. Daily water intake sufficient (often mint tea).

### **Module 3: Monthly Trend Analysis**

#### **3.1 Exercise Trends**
*   **Weekly Exercise Volume Changes:**
    *   **Week 1 (1st-7th):** Exercise volume steady, primarily walks and housework, introduced Baduanjin on weekend. Volume had minor fluctuations due to holiday and craft delivery.
    *   **Week 2 (8th-15th):** Exercise volume peaked. Baduanjin practice became routine, combined with heavy weekend seasonal housework, garden management, and frequent family social activities.
    *   **Week 3 (16th-22nd):** Exercise volume remained high, but structure changed. To accommodate entrance exams, morning exercise persisted but intensity may have been slightly gentler, housework timing adjusted under family "quiet mode".
    *   **Week 4 (23rd-30th):** Exercise volume remained ample. Added community mutual aid gardening labor (26th-28th), morning exercise habit solidified. Late month, due to accident impact, exercise focused on regular morning routine, heavy labor reduced.
*   **Exercise Performance Changes:** Baduanjin performance showed a continuous improvement curve. From unfamiliar to coherent, duration increased from 15 to 20 minutes, demonstrating your good adaptability and learning ability for gentle wellness exercises.

#### **3.2 Health Trends**
*   **Sleep Trends:**
    *   Weeks 1-2: Sleep duration stable, quality good. Week 3: Bedtime earlier due to exam "quiet early sleep" plan, sleep security high. Week 4, especially after the 25th accident, sleep duration and quality showed short-term fluctuations due to anxiety, but gradually stabilized over the weekend (28th-30th) through talking and action (updating first-aid kit).
*   **Physical Health Trends:**
    *   **Weight:** Showed a "stepwise" slow decline. Slight increase after holiday (early week 1), then continued decline through regular activity and daily diet, stabilizing at 54.0kg by month-end. Data shows your metabolism and activity pattern effectively balanced calories even after family meals.
    *   **Mental Health Trends:**
        *   Stress and mood curves highly synchronized with key family events. Exam period was sustained "concern-type" stress; accident period was "acute anxiety-type" stress. You managed stress by confiding in mother/neighbors and taking pragmatic actions (handling insurance, planning risk fund), with relatively quick emotional recovery.
    *   **Injury Impact:**
        *   **Mild Wrist Strain (noticed 3rd, worsened 11th):** Triggered by consecutive craft activities. You promptly intervened with heat therapy and reduced craft time, effectively alleviated between 12th-15th, no long-term impact on core life functions.

#### **3.3 Life Rhythm Trends**
*   **Sleep Schedule & Mental State:** Data shows when your bedtime was earlier than 23:00 (e.g., 8th, 13th, 20th), next-day mental state descriptions were more positive ("content", "calm"). After staying up late (e.g., 4th, 24th), next-day state was often described as "tired".
*   **Work/Life Rhythm Changes:**
    *   **Work Intensity Changes:** Craft order delivery on June 4th and new order confirmation on June 7th brought short-term work excitement and subsequent production period. Temporary order on June 24th caused late night work.
    *   **Life Change Impact:** Eldest son's entrance exams (week 3) led to comprehensive family schedule adjustment, entertainment paused. Husband's accident (week 4) disrupted original life focus, prompting you to shift significant energy towards risk prevention and family safety security matters.

### **Module 4: Personalized Insights**

*   **Morning Habit ↔ Daily Energy:** Data shows that after persisting with the "walk + Baduanjin" morning routine for over 15 days, the frequency of your self-reported "more energetic during the day" and "less prone to fatigue" significantly increased. This indicates that the daily ~45-minute combination of low-intensity morning activities positively impacted your daytime energy levels and emotional stability.
*   **Family Stress Event ↔ Health Coping Pattern:** Facing your husband's accident (acute stress), your health habits demonstrated resilience. Morning exercise was not interrupted, serving as a stabilizing anchor during the stressful period. Simultaneously, you adopted a dual coping strategy of "confiding (to mother, neighbors) + pragmatic action (researching insurance, setting up risk fund, updating first-aid kit)", effectively preventing prolonged anxiety and transforming it into positive actions to enhance family safety.
*   **Lifestyle Activities ↔ Weight Management:** Without deliberate dieting or intense exercise, your weight decreased by 0.5kg this month. Combined with data, this is primarily attributed to: 1) **Extremely high proportion of lifestyle-based physical activity** (housework, gardening, walking); 2) **Regular morning exercise** boosting basal metabolism; 3) **Stable home-cooked diet structure**. This indicates your current "integrated into life" activity pattern is very effective for maintaining a healthy weight.
*   **Social Mutual Aid ↔ Mental Health:** This month's multiple instances of neighborly mutual aid (giving zongzi, fixing screens, sharing produce, organizing garden) and deep exchanges with relatives/friends (video call with sister, comforting close friend) not only did not increase your burden, but were repeatedly described as bringing "warmth", "comfort", "sense of value". This suggests your family and community-centered social model is an important source of psychological nourishment and stress buffering.

### **Module 5: Anomalous Event Summary**

1.  **Injury Event: Mild Right Wrist Strain**
    *   **Occurrence Time:** June 3rd (first noticed), June 11th (worsened after craft corner activity).
    *   **Impact Scope:** Caused soreness/discomfort during craft activities, prompting you to actively reduce craft time from 11th-13th.
    *   **Recovery Status:** Through heat therapy and rest, discomfort largely disappeared by June 15th. No subsequent reports of discomfort during craft activities, good recovery.

2.  **Health Indicator Fluctuation Event: Acute Emotional Stress & Anxiety**
    *   **Occurrence Time:** Evening of June 25th (lasting into 26th).
    *   **Fluctuating Indicator & Magnitude:** Emotional state shifted sharply from "pragmatic" to "panic", "lingering fear", accompanied by significant worry and sleep disturbance.
    *   **Fluctuation Cause:** Husband's traffic accident while delivering goods.
    *   **Subsequent Changes:** After confirming husband's safety and understanding insurance claim process, mood shifted to "pragmatic" on 26th. Through subsequent series of risk management actions (studying policy, setting up risk fund), anxiety continued to decrease, returning to a mindset of "fulfilled", "determined" by 28th-30th.

3.  **Life Rhythm Anomaly Event: Late-Night Work Rush & Study**
    *   **Anomalous Periods:** June 24th (until 00:30), June 29th (until 23:10).
    *   **Anomaly Type:** Active late nights due to temporary craft order delivery and driving test theory study.
    *   **Impact on Health/Exercise:** Increased fatigue the following day, but did not affect adherence to morning exercise habit.
    *   **Recovery Measures & Effect:** Events were one-off, did not form a long-term late-night pattern. Subsequent adjustment of time management restored normal sleep schedule.
