**Monthly Trend Analysis**
*   **3.1 Activity Trends**
    *   **Weekly Activity Volume Changes**:
        *   Week 1 (1st-7th): Activity routine established, Baduanjin and walking frequency stable.
        *   Weeks 2-3 (8th-21st): Total activity volume: walking frequency slightly reduced due to lower back discomfort (canceled on 17th), but Baduanjin maintained, household labor increased (cleaning, renovations).
        *   Week 4 (22nd-30th): Full activity recovery, walking duration increased, and new family outdoor activities added.
    *   **Training Cycle Peaks/Lows**:
        *   Peak performance week: Week 4, highest family activity participation, positive mood, stable activity performance.
        *   Low week: Mid-late Week 2, activity motivation and consistency affected by physical strain.
    *   **Activity Performance Changes**: Baduanjin movement fluidity and breath coordination improved weekly with practice. Walking heart rate and pace overall stable, pace may have slightly decreased during fatigue period (Week 2).
*   **3.2 Health Trends**
    *   **Sleep Trends**: Weeks 1 and 4 had the best sleep duration and quality. Weeks 2-3, due to caregiving stress and physical discomfort, sleep duration occasionally compressed, deep sleep percentage may have slightly decreased.
    *   **Physical Health Trends**: Weight showed a decreasing trend in Weeks 2-3, aligning with stress period; slightly rebounded in Week 4 with stress relief and family meals. Resting heart rate and HRV change trends negatively correlated with stress cycle.
    *   **Mental Health Trends**: Stress levels peaked in Weeks 2-3, triggered by mother's illness and child education anxiety. Week 4 saw significant stress relief through socializing (exchange meetings, craft friends) and family support, mood shifted positive.
    *   **Injury Impact**: Lower back strain occurring April 8th-15th led to one walking session pause in late Week 2 and continued to affect household chore intensity in Week 3.
*   **3.3 Life Rhythm Trends**
    *   **Sleep Schedule & Mental State**: On days following bedtime after 23:00, morning practice energy levels were slightly lower, and household chore efficiency slightly decreased.
    *   **Work/Life Rhythm Changes**: Week 2 life rhythm was tense due to mother's care, commuting and caregiving time encroached on personal leisure. Week 4 life rhythm became fulfilling and purpose-driven due to securing community job and exhibition preparation.

**Personalized Insights**
*   **Sleep ↔ Activity Performance**: Data shows that when bedtime is before 22:40, the next day's morning Baduanjin practice has higher movement completion and longer, more relaxed breathing. Conversely, after late nights on April 2nd and 14th, the next day's morning practice felt slightly less energetic.
*   **Stress ↔ Health**: Data shows that during the high-stress caregiving period of April 8th-15th, weight decreased by 0.8kg, while perceived fatigue significantly increased, indicating psychological stress and physical exertion jointly impacted basal metabolism and expenditure. After stress relief, weight and energy levels recovered simultaneously.
*   **Activity Type ↔ Physical State**: Comparison shows that regular Baduanjin practice (daily adherence) has clear benefits for maintaining morning energy and improving shoulder/neck stiffness. However, the high-intensity cleaning labor on April 17th (single session 3 hours) directly exacerbated lower back discomfort, indicating limited tolerance for sustained bending and load-bearing in middle-aged women.
*   **Behavioral Habits ↔ Overall Health**: Data shows that maintaining the daily morning exercise habit (regardless of duration) positively correlates with monthly emotional stability. Homemade meals ≥27 days/month, combined with moderate household activity, is key to maintaining stable weight and good body fat levels. The evening walking habit (≥5 times/week) significantly aids in relieving daytime stress and maintaining non-exercise step goals.

**Abnormal Event Summary**
*   **Injury/Illness Event**:
    *   **Occurrence Time**: Induced during April 8th to 15th period, symptoms pronounced on the 17th.
    *   **Injury Type**: Lower back muscle strain (stiffness, soreness).
    *   **Impact Scope**: Led to cancellation of evening walk on April 17th, and required extra attention to posture during household chores in following days, avoiding heavy lifting.
    *   **Recovery Status**: After husband's massage, self-rest and adjustment (e.g., April 17th midday nap), and reducing improper load, symptoms gradually alleviated after April 20th, basically recovered by month end, without affecting morning practice.
*   **Health Metric Fluctuation Event**:
    *   **Fluctuating Metric**: Weight.
    *   **Fluctuation Time**: April 2nd to 15th.
    *   **Fluctuation Magnitude**: Cumulative decrease of 0.8kg.
    *   **Fluctuation Cause**: Associated with stress and anxiety from mother's care during the period, and possibly accompanying irregular eating.
    *   **Subsequent Change**: After April 16th, with partial resolution of stressor and return to regular life, weight gradually recovered and stabilized around 54.8kg.
*   **Life Rhythm Anomaly Event**:
    *   **Anomaly Period**: April 8th to 15th.
    *   **Anomaly Type**: Due to mother's acute illness requiring frequent care and companionship, daily sleep schedule, commuting patterns, and household arrangements were all disrupted.
    *   **Impact on Health/Activity**: Daily sleep time possibly compressed, mental stress increased, regular activities like evening walks disrupted, ultimately triggering physical strain.
    *   **Recovery Measures & Effect**: After the 15th, mother's condition stabilized, care frequency reduced; proactively adjusted rhythm, sought husband's assistance, and after completing financial planning on the 22nd, psychological stress reduced, life rhythm returned to stable and orderly in Week 4.
