    *   Activity Types & Proportions: Household chores (~39%), Baduanjin (~32%), Walking (~19%), Handicraft work (sedentary, ~10%).
    *   Activity Intensity Distribution: Z1 Low Intensity (Baduanjin, Walking) ~22.5 hours; Z2 Moderate Intensity (cleaning, carrying) ~75 hours; Z3 High Intensity (flow state during concentrated order work, intense emotional fluctuations) proportion small.
*   **Activity Statistics & Best Performance**:
