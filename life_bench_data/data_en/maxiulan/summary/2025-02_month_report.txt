**Module 3: Monthly Trend Analysis**

**3.1 Activity Trends**
*   **Weekly Activity Volume Changes**:
    *   Week 1 (1st-7th): Activity mainly household work & 1 walk, proactive exercise not started, total activity low.
    *   Week 2 (8th-14th): Baduanjin practice initiated (3 sessions), completed 1 community teaching walk, proactive activity volume increased ~150% week-over-week.
    *   Week 3 (15th-21st): Affected by child's illness, proactive exercise break 18th-20th, weekly activity volume decreased ~40% week-over-week. However, established regular morning practice (15th, 17th).
    *   Week 4 (22nd-28th): Resumed and intensified exercise, completed 4 Baduanjin sessions, 1 walk, market activity. Weekly activity volume reached monthly peak, increased ~120% week-over-week.
*   **Training Cycle Peaks/Valleys**:
    *   Peak Week: Week 4, best exercise consistency, successfully transformed craft activity into market behavior, high sense of achievement.
    *   Valley Week: Mid-Week 3 (18th-20th), complete exercise interruption due to unexpected family health event.
*   **Activity Performance Changes**: Baduanjin movement proficiency and completion comfort improved weekly with practice, progressing from initial unfamiliarity and uncoordinated breathing to independently completing a smooth 15-minute session by Week 4.

**3.2 Health Trends**
*   **Sleep Trends**: Overall stable sleep duration. Self-reported deep sleep quality improved after consistent walking and Baduanjin (especially Week 4). Sleep interruptions mainly related to thoughts (teaching, parent-teacher meeting) and family evening activities (making lanterns).
*   **Physical Health Trends**:
    *   Weight showed "Plateau - Slight Rise - Decline - Stabilization" trend: Weeks 1-2 post-holiday recovery plateau; slight rise on 12th due to social dining; entered decline channel from 18th due to healthy diet and caregiving fatigue; stabilized at new level by month-end due to increased activity.
    *   Body fat % trended downward slowly in sync with weight.
    *   Stress & emotion trends strongly correlated with key events: Teaching success, market success brought positive emotional peaks; child's illness, education anxiety brought stress and emotional lows.
*   **Injury Impact**: Mild right wrist strain 16th-19th, reduced craft output during that period, prompted greater attention to work-rest balance, mostly recovered after 19th.

**3.3 Life Rhythm Trends**
*   **Routine & Mental State**: Data shows that on days with bedtime before 22:30 (e.g., 2nd, 6th), your described mood the next day was often "content," "calm"; while on days with bedtime after 23:30 (e.g., 5th, 14th, 27th), the next day was often accompanied by descriptions like "slightly tired," "mind racing."
*   **Work/Life Rhythm Changes**: Weeks 2 & 4 had high-intensity community work (teaching, market), accompanied by increased social dining, temporarily affecting weight; Week 3 had heavy family caregiving tasks, encroaching on personal exercise & leisure time, but deepened family healthy diet practice.

**Module 4: Personalized Insights**

*   **Sleep ↔ Activity Performance**: Data shows that on days you took an evening walk (e.g., 24th) or morning Baduanjin (e.g., 25th), you fell asleep more easily at night and self-reported feeling "refreshed" the next day. Conversely, on days with extremely high daytime household/mental labor intensity but no active relaxation exercise (e.g., 14th post parent-teacher meeting), you were prone to "overthinking leading to late sleep" that night.
*   **Stress/Family Events ↔ Health**: The "18th-20th child illness" event chain clearly shows: Family health stress event → leads to complete interruption of exercise (-3 days) → simultaneously accompanied by meticulous preparation of light meals → weight short-term decrease of 0.3kg. This indicates you prioritize family care under stress and partially offset the impact of reduced activity through dietary management.
*   **Activity Type ↔ Physical State**: Comparative analysis reveals a direct correlation between "Baduanjin" practice and alleviation of your described "shoulder/neck/back discomfort" (tried starting 8th, felt significantly reduced by 24th). "Walking" shows stronger correlation with the feeling of "more restful sleep" (described on 1st, 24th). These two low-intensity activities provide complementary health benefits for you.
*   **Behavioral Habits ↔ Overall Health**: The core drivers for this month's health outcomes were the "family light diet plan initiated and maintained after the 18th" and the "regular exercise habit resumed and intensified in Week 4." Data shows that in Week 4, when both were combined, your weight reached the monthly low point (55.1kg) and your emotional sense of value (community, market success) peaked.
