Although I do not have a regular habit of undergoing medical check-ups, I pay close attention to how my body feels and address minor ailments promptly. I rarely participate in physical exercise, but my daily household chores and family care activities involve a significant amount of physical effort, which helps maintain basic physical functions. My personal care habits are relatively traditional, with a focus on cleanliness and dietary adjustments.",
  "lifestyle_desc": "Life revolves around family and community, characterized by a traditional and pragmatic style. The primary source of information is television, which is watched most frequently during leisure time, almost daily. Social activities are frequent, with gatherings among friends and relatives who do not live together occurring several times a month. Handicrafts, such as embroidery, are an important leisure hobby and are also practiced several times a month. Internet usage is mainly for socializing and accessing life-related information, with a frequency of about several times a month. Physical exercise or attending live sports events are never engaged in, while reading books or newspapers, shopping, and participating in cultural activities are also infrequent. There have been no overnight stays away from home for vacations or visiting relatives in the past year. The pace of life is stable, with a focus on interaction and harmony within the family.",

Among this, Ma Xiulan's personal annual income from part-time and casual work is about 5,000 yuan. The family owns a self-occupied property but does not possess a household car. There are no investment activities such as stocks, funds, or bonds. The family's finances primarily revolve around savings and covering basic living expenses, with frugal consumption habits and a focus on living within their means.",
  "work_desc": "Currently, there is no fixed full-time job. The main responsibilities involve managing household chores and taking care of three children. Occasionally, some local manual odd jobs or seasonal farm work are taken on to supplement the family income, with irregular working hours and meager, unstable earnings. The current work-life situation, centered around the family, is generally accepted, with work primarily consisting of physical labor and household management.",
  "experience_desc": "Ma Xiulan was born and has always lived in the Jinghai District of Tianjin, making her a native of the area with a household registration that has never been relocated. After graduating from junior high school, she worked for several years in agriculture, forestry, animal husbandry, and fishing in her hometown, primarily responsible for growing vegetables and caring for livestock. This was her first and only formal full-time job, an experience that equipped her with practical life skills. After getting married in 2005, and with the birth of her eldest son in 2010, followed by her second son and youngest daughter, she gradually shifted her focus entirely to her family, becoming a full-time homemaker. Her life journey has been relatively simple yet fulfilling, centered around her hometown, family, and community. From the hard work in the fields to the warm care of her household, her life has followed a stable and traditional path. Major life events include her marriage in 2005 and the subsequent births of her three children, which form the core of her life. She also actively participates in local community activities and maintains close relationships with her neighbors.",

Ma Xiulan got to know Zhao Jianguo through her husband's factory gatherings and occasional family visits. Zhao Jianguo has an outgoing and cheerful personality, often being the life of the party. Sometimes, he would bring vegetables from his own garden or fish he caught to visit Ma Xiulan's home. Both families live in the Jinghai District, not far from each other, and they stay in touch about once or twice a month. Most of the contact is between her husband and Zhao Jianguo, discussing work or planning weekend fishing trips. Occasionally, the two families get together for simple meals during holidays. Ma Xiulan has a good impression of him, considering him sincere and responsible toward his family."
