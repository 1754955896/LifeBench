This product offers clear terms regarding health declarations and coverage for pre-existing conditions, providing relatively comprehensive protection for conditions like hyperlipidemia and avoiding potential claim disputes that may arise in the future due to this issue. The annual premium of 2,680 yuan is a reasonable cost for this peace of mind. Moving forward, we need to encourage my father to maintain a healthy diet and undergo regular check-ups.",

I need to contact the insurance agent, Chen Ming, immediately to inquire specifically about: 1. The coverage for treatments related to my father’s degenerative joint disease (a pre-existing condition) after the insurance policy was taken out; 2. The specific reimbursement scope and procedures for special outpatient services, such as physical therapy.
