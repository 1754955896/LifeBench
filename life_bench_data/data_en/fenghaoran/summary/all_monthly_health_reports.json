Resting heart rate maintained a good average level due to consistent exercise.\n    *   **Lifestyle Rhythm:** In the latter half of the month (Spring Festival holiday), sleep-wake schedule delayed by approximately 1.5 hours, screen time decreased, while frequency of social gatherings and family activities increased significantly.\n*   **Core Focus Areas:** This month, you frequently focused on **the progress of your monthly running goal**, began paying close attention to **lower back health and core strength improvement** after the physical exam, and also engaged in insurance planning and dietary guidance for family health.\n\n### **Module 2: Monthly Review**\n\n#### **2.1 Exercise Review**\n*   **Exercise Overview:**\n    *   Exercise Types and Proportions: Running (65.2%), Strength Training (34.8%).\n    *   Intensity Zone Distribution: Inferred based on exercise types, Z2 (Moderate Intensity, Running) duration accounts for approximately 87%, Z3 (High Intensity, Strength Training) duration accounts for approximately 13%.\n*   **Statistics and Best Performance by Exercise:**\n    *   **Running:**\n        *   Total Distance: 81.0 kilometers; Average Pace: Approximately 6'00\"-6'30\"/km (inferred).\n        *   Longest Single Distance: 8 kilometers (January 11th, January 25th).\n        *   Fastest Pace: Estimated around 5'50\"/km (based on the high-quality run on January 25th to complete the goal).\n        *   Average Heart Rate: Approximately 135-145 bpm (inferred); Maximum Heart Rate: Approximately 160 bpm (inferred).\n    *   **Strength Training:**\n        *   Total Duration: 120 minutes.\n        *   Longest Single Session: 30 minutes (January 22nd, indoor core training).\n        *   Core Exercises: Primarily exercises such as planks, resistance band rows, bird-dogs.\n*   **Exercise Habit Preferences:**\n    *   High-Frequency Exercise Days: Saturday, Wednesday.\n    *   High-Frequency Exercise Time Slot: Early morning 6:30-7:30 (over 80%).\n    *   Exercise Locations: Yuelu South Road (primary running route, 70%), Home (strength training and rainy-day training, 30%).\n    *   Exercise Consistency: Longest consecutive exercise streak was 5 days (January 11th-15th). The main break period was the Spring Festival holiday (January 28th-31st, 4 days total), due to returning home for family reunions, with exercise mode adjusted to family walks and indoor activities.\n\n#### **2.2 Health Review**\n*   **Sleep:**\n    *   Average Daily Sleep Duration: Approximately 7 hours on weekdays, approximately 8 hours on weekends and holidays.\n    *   Sleep Stage Inference: Deep sleep accounts for approximately 20-25% (during the period of regular exercise), light sleep accounts for approximately 50-55%, REM accounts for approximately 20-25%.\n    *   Sleep Schedule Stability: Bedtime fluctuates between 23:00-00:00 on weekdays, wake-up time between 6:30-6:50, relatively regular. Weekend and holiday sleep schedule delayed by 1-2 hours.\n    *   Sleep Interruptions: Generally infrequent, but notable sleep deprivation occurred on January 21st (staying up late for a project) and January 28th (staying up on New Year's Eve).\n*   **Physiological Indicators:**\n    *   **Weight:** Month-start value 75.0kg, month-end value 76.2kg, overall increase of 1.2kg. Weekly averages show a trend of \"stable in the early period (75.0-75.8kg), sharp rise in the late period (75.5-76.2kg)\". The largest fluctuation occurred from January 28th-31st (Spring Festival holiday), with an increase of 1.2kg.\n    *   **Body Fat Percentage (Inferred):** Based on physical exam data (approximately 21% on January 9th) and weight changes, inferred month-end value is approximately 21.5%-21.8%, showing a slight overall increase.\n    *   **Resting Heart Rate (Inferred):** Daily average approximately 55-60 bpm. Expected to be at a lower level during periods of regular morning runs (approximately 55 bpm), possibly slightly increased to 58-60 bpm in late January due to high work pressure and later holiday dietary/schedule changes.\n    *   **HRV (Inferred):** Daily average at a medium to high level. Shows higher values during periods of regular exercise and controlled stress (e.g., mid-January); may show short-term declines during late-night work sessions (January 21st) and periods of sudden lifestyle rhythm changes during holidays.\n*   **Mental Health:**\n    *   **Stress:** Daily average stress level moderate. High-stress periods concentrated on January 10th, January 16th (urgent client consultation), January 20th-21st (multi-day project). Primary stress sources were work deadlines and urgent client needs. Stress levels significantly decreased during the Spring Festival holiday (after January 28th).\n    *   **Mood:** Predominant mood tags were \"focused\", \"fulfilled\", and \"pleasant\". Mood fluctuation periods: work high-stress periods accompanied by \"anxiety\" or \"fatigue\"; mood significantly elevated to \"pleasant\", \"satisfied\" upon goal achievement (January 25th) and during family reunion periods (January 28th-30th).\n    *   **Health Score (Inferred):** Daily average score good. Highest scores expected on days of exercise goal achievement and family health day (January 25th, 30th); lowest score expected on the morning after consecutive late-night work sessions (January 22nd).\n\n#### **2.3 Lifestyle Rhythm Review**\n*   **Sleep-Wake Habits:**\n    *   Weekdays: Average bedtime 23:30, average wake-up time 6:40.\n    *   Weekends/Holidays: Average bedtime 23:45, average wake-up time 8:00.\n    *   Difference: Weekends average 15 minutes later bedtime and 80 minutes later wake-up time compared to weekdays.\n    *   Days with Disrupted Sleep Schedule: Approximately 8 days (bedtime after 24:00), reasons include overtime work, friend gatherings, staying up on New Year's Eve.\n*   **Commute/Activity:**\n    *   Average Daily Non-Exercise Steps: Approximately 5,000 steps. Highest step week during Spring Festival family activity period, lowest step week during rainy workweek.\n    *   Commute Mode: Combination of subway/driving, one-way distance approximately 10 kilometers, average daily commute time 45 minutes.\n    *   Business Trip/Travel: Returned to Wuhan from January 28th-31st for the holiday. Impact: Exercise mode shifted from regular morning runs to family walks, sleep duration increased but rhythm delayed, proportion of high-oil/salt foods in diet increased.\n*   **Daily Life:**\n    *   Screen Time: Average daily total duration approximately 9-10 hours (work: 6-7 hours; entertainment/learning: 2-3 hours). Highest duration occurred on January 20th-21st while handling the multi-day project.\n    *   Dietary Habits: High regularity of three meals per day (approximately 28 days regular). Diet structure was high-protein, balanced carbs in the early period, shifting to high-carb, high-fat in the late period (Spring Festival). Number of takeout meals approximately 8, home-cooked meals approximately 22. Average daily water intake approximately 1.8L.\n\n### **Module 3: Monthly Trend Analysis**\n\n#### **3.1 Exercise Trends**\n*   **Weekly Exercise Volume Changes:**\n    *   Week 1: Initiation period, 3 exercise sessions (all running), running volume 19 kilometers.\n    *   Week 2: Improvement period, 5 exercise sessions (4 running + 1 strength), running volume 24 kilometers, total exercise volume increased by 60% week-over-week due to weekend long-distance run and initiation of strength training.\n    *   Week 3: Peak and integration period, 6 exercise sessions (4 running + 2 strength), running volume 23 kilometers, exercise frequency reached the monthly peak, strength training habit consolidated.\n    *   Week 4: Wind-down and fluctuation period, 5 exercise sessions (4 running + 1 strength), running volume 15 kilometers, exercise volume decreased week-over-week due to work projects and pre-holiday preparations; exercise mode changed during the late holiday period.\n*   **Training Cycle Peaks/Valleys:**\n    *   **Peak Week:** Week 3. Highest exercise frequency, good combination of running and strength training, body recovered from initial lower back tension, exercise performance stable.\n    *   **Valley Period:** The latter half of Week 4 (Spring Festival holiday). Exercise hiatus, mode change, exercise load significantly reduced.\n*   **Exercise Performance Changes:** Running pace remained stable overall. Strength training progressed from none to regular, with completion quality and duration gradually improving in Weeks 2-3. After Week 3, due to the addition of strength training, lower back tension significantly eased, improving exercise comfort.\n\n#### **3.2 Health Trends**\n*   **Sleep Trends:** Sleep duration and rhythm stable for the first three weeks. In Week 4 due to the holiday, total sleep duration increased (especially January 28th-30th), but bedtime significantly delayed, causing a shift in sleep rhythm. Deep sleep percentage remained good during the first three weeks of exercise, possibly fluctuating in Week 4 due to dietary and schedule changes.\n*   **Physical Health Trends:**\n    *   **Weight/Body Fat:** Fluctuated within a narrow range (75.0-75.8kg) in Weeks 1-3, trend stable. Showed rapid, significant increase in Week 4 due to Spring Festival diet.\n    *   **Resting Heart Rate/HRV:** Resting heart rate maintained at a lower level in the first three weeks, positively correlated with regular exercise. HRV trend correlated with stress and recovery, possibly briefly declining during high work pressure periods (mid-Week 3), rebounding at the start of the holiday (early Week 4) due to removal of work stress.\n*   **Mental Health Trends:** Stress levels showed a clear cycle of \"accumulation on weekdays, release on weekends, reset to zero on holiday\". Mood negatively correlated with stress, positively correlated with goal achievement events (completing running volume, family health activities).\n*   **Injury Impact:** Experienced minor lower back muscle tightness from January 12th-14th. Impact: Led to pausing running on January 13th, opting for rest. Recovery: Effectively alleviated after January 15th through increased targeted strength training (starting January 12th) and attention to posture, not affecting monthly goal completion.\n\n#### **3.3 Lifestyle Rhythm Trends**\n*   **Sleep Schedule and Mental State:** Data shows that on days following bedtime after 24:00 (e.g., January 3rd, 22nd), the mental state description for that day was \"slightly fatigued\", \"sluggish\", and willingness or performance for morning runs may have decreased.\n*   **Work/Life Rhythm Changes:** Work intensity peaked in mid-Week 3 (January 20th-21st) due to the multi-day project, leading to compressed exercise time and late nights. Life rhythm completely transformed in Week 4 (Spring Festival), with social and family activities becoming dominant, and proactive exercise/health management giving way to traditional festive patterns.\n\n### **Module 4: Personalized Insights**\n\n*   **Sleep ↔ Exercise Performance:** Data shows that when you maintain a regular weekday sleep schedule (bedtime before 23:30), the execution rate for next-day morning runs is 100%, with a self-reported feeling of \"refreshed and clear-headed\". The reverse correlation shows that after staying up until 00:30 on January 21st, you proactively changed the next day's (22nd) outdoor run to indoor training, automatically reducing exercise intensity.\n*   **Travel/Pressure ↔ Health:** Returning home for Spring Festival (simulating a short business trip) significantly impacted health indicators: data shows weight increased by 1.2kg within 4 holiday days, body fat percentage estimated to rise 0.5%-0.8%, resting heart rate possibly increased by 3-5 bpm. However, it also brought stress levels to zero and significantly elevated mood, indicating this \"pressure\" had positive significance for mental health.\n*   **Exercise Type ↔ Physical State:** Comparative analysis found that after introducing twice-weekly strength training (Weeks 2, 3), the frequency and intensity of your reported descriptions of \"lower back tightness\", \"slight pain\" significantly decreased. The combination of running and strength training effectively addressed the \"weak core muscle groups\" identified in the physical exam, forming a positive cycle.\n*   **Behavioral Habits ↔ Overall Health:** Stable sleep schedule is foundational: the first 23 days of the month with regular sleep schedule corresponded to stable health status. Diet is a key variable for weight: data shows that during periods of concentrated dining out/festivities (e.g., January 10th, 28th-31st), weight showed noticeable increases (0.3-0.5kg/day). Screen time and sleep: Excessive screen time on January 21st (overtime) directly led to delayed bedtime until 00:30, breaking the sleep schedule regularity.\n\n### **Module 5: Anomaly Event Summary**\n\n*   **Injury Event:**\n    *   **Event:** Lower back muscle tightness.\n    *   **Time:** January 12th-14th.\n    *   **Impact:** Led to pausing the planned morning run on January 13th.\n    *   **Recovery:** Through persistent core strength training starting January 12th, and attention to stretching and posture in daily life, basically alleviated after January 15th with no recurrence.\n*   **Exercise Hiatus Event:**\n    *   **Event:** Interruption of regular exercise mode during Spring Festival holiday.\n    *   **Time:** January 28th-31st, 4 days total.\n    *   **Reason:** Returning home for family reunion, traditional festival arrangements took precedence.\n    *   **Recovery Performance:** Maintained basic activity level through family walks and daily activities during this period; expected to resume regular morning runs on February 1st.\n*   **Health Indicator Sudden Change Event:**\n    *   **Event:** Short-term rapid weight increase.\n    *   **Indicator/Time/Magnitude:** Weight, January 28th to 31st, increased by 1.2kg within 4 days.\n    *   **Reason:** Consecutive family meals, high-calorie diet, and schedule changes during the Spring Festival holiday.\n    *   **Subsequent Change:** This is a short-term festive fluctuation, expected to subside within 2-3 weeks after resuming daily diet and exercise routine.\n*   **Lifestyle Rhythm Anomaly Event:**\n    *   **Event:** Consecutive late nights due to urgent work project.\n    *   **Time:** January 20th-21st.\n    *   **Impact:** Average daily sleep less than 6 hours, decreased mental state on January 22nd, adjusted exercise to low-intensity indoor training.\n    *   **Recovery Measures and Effect:** Proactively went to bed early (22:45) on January 22nd for compensation, mental state and exercise performance recovered on January 23rd.",

Reason: Life/work rhythm stabilized, actively adjusted training plan, incorporated strength training.\n*   **Training Cycle Peaks/Troughs:**\n    *   **Peak Week:** Week 4. Highest exercise frequency, diverse types, running pace showing recovery trend.\n    *   **Trough Week:** Week 2. Systematic training completely interrupted due to Spring Festival holiday.\n*   **Exercise Performance Changes:**\n    *   **Running Pace:** Recovery run pace only 5'40\"/km in Week 3 (21st), improved to 5'10\"/km by Week 4 (28th), indicating aerobic capacity recovering quickly. **Correlation Analysis:** Pace improvement positively correlated with increased weekly running frequency and gradual sleep improvement (noise issue alleviated).\n\n#### **3.2 Health Trends**\n*   **Sleep Trends:**\n    *   Duration and quality showed \"V\" shape change: Week 2 holiday sleep longest but possibly irregular, Week 3 post-return duration and quality dropped sharply due to stress and noise, Week 4 gradually recovered after proactive communication and adjustment.\n    *   Sleep Continuity: Week 3 (20th-22nd) severely affected by neighbor noise, 3 consecutive days of significant sleep interruptions, affecting daytime alertness.\n*   **Physiological Health Trends:**\n    *   **Weight/Body Fat:** Rapid rise Week 2, steady decline Weeks 3 & 4, forming a \"roller coaster\" curve. **Spike Node:** Peaked on 11th, triggered by consecutive days of gatherings.\n    *   **Resting Heart Rate/HRV:** Showed negative correlation trend. Week 3 estimated higher RHR, lower HRV, corresponding to work pressure and poor sleep; Week 4 both improved.\n*   **Mental Health Trends:**\n    *   **Stress Value:** Highly synchronized with work intensity. Weeks 1 & 3 high-stress weeks, Weeks 2 & 4 low-stress weeks. **High-Stress Trigger Events:** 6th project review & overtime, 19th-20th client meeting preparation & communication.\n    *   **Exercise & Mental Correlation:** Data shows that after increased exercise frequency in Week 4 (≥4 sessions/week), frequency of \"joyful\" mood tag increased, perceived stress decreased.\n*   **Injury Impact:**\n    *   Minor calf strain on 21st led to avoiding high-intensity running/jumping for the next 2 days, but did not affect daily activities or low-intensity exercise. Strength training on 28th likely included targeted recovery and strengthening.\n\n#### **3.3 Life Rhythm Trends**\n*   **Sleep & Mental State:** Data shows that on days following bedtime past 23:30 (e.g., 20th, 24th), keywords like \"fatigued,\" \"decreased focus\" appeared in daily descriptions, affecting exercise willingness or performance.\n*   **Work/Life Rhythm Changes:**\n    *   **Week 3 Work Intensity Surge:** Returned to work facing high-intensity tasks like client meetings, quarterly planning, directly squeezing exercise and sleep time.\n    *   **Life Change Impact:** \"Neighbor noise\" issue emerging in Week 3 created an additional shock to the state needing stable routine post-return, forming a dual challenge of \"work pressure + life disturbance.\"\n\n---\n\n### **Module 4: Personalized Insights**\n\n*   **Sleep ↔ Exercise Performance:**\n    *   Data shows that **when sleep duration ≥7.5 hours and uninterrupted (e.g., 23rd)**, the focus and satisfaction during creative activities (street photography) the next/same day were extremely high. Conversely, **when sleep was interrupted by noise (e.g., 20th-21st)**, perceived exertion (RPE) during the next morning's run increased, and recovery efficiency decreased.\n    *   **Reverse Correlation:** Engaging in high-intensity mental work in the evening (e.g., working until 00:30 on 19th) directly led to delayed sleep onset, and even with sufficient total duration, sleep quality was significantly compromised, affecting the next day's overall state.\n*   **Business Trip/Pressure ↔ Health:**\n    *   **Quantified Impact of Spring Festival Homecoming (Simulated Business Trip):** Compared to normal rhythm, during homecoming: average daily exercise duration decreased by **100%**, average sleep time shifted (later bedtime/wake-up) by **1.5 hours**, weekly weight gain reached **1.0kg**. Data shows even a one-week change in life rhythm significantly impacts physiological metrics.\n    *   **Impact of Work Pressure on Health:** During high-pressure work weeks (e.g., Week 3), even while maintaining morning run habit, estimated RHR was **3-5 bpm higher** than low-pressure weeks, and reliance on caffeine for alertness increased. Pressure did not directly cause dietary loss of control but affected the body's recovery level.\n*   **Exercise Type ↔ Physical State:**\n    *   **Effect of Exercise Variety:** After introducing **strength training** at month-end (28th), combined with existing running, your confidence in physical preparation for \"spring camping\" increased. This indicates that within your current exercise framework, adding strength training has a positive psychological priming effect for achieving specific life goals.\n    *   **Exercise Load & Weight:** Data shows that **when weekly exercise sessions ≥4 and include different types (Week 4)**, weight showed a stable downward trend (weekly drop 0.2kg), and mood was more positive. When relying solely on running or with insufficient exercise frequency, weight control effect weakened.\n*   **Behavioral Habits ↔ Overall Health:**\n    *   **Power of Stable Routine:** During non-holiday periods, on **days with bedtime consistently before 23:30**, your estimated average daily health score was above 80 points. Once bedtime was later than 23:30 for two consecutive days, the score dropped below 75.\n    *   **Proactive Problem-Solving & Mental Health:** Facing the \"neighbor noise\" issue, the behavioral shift from passive endurance (20th) to proactive, friendly communication (22nd) transformed your mood from \"slightly annoyed\" to \"proactively addressing,\" significantly reducing the psychological burden of the sleep problem. This confirms the importance of your ENTJ personality trait of \"proactive problem-solving\" for maintaining mental health.\n\n---\n\n### **Module 5: Anomaly Event Summary**\n\n*   **Injury Event:**",

Lowest score 6/10 (March 11th, 20th, late-night overtime), highest score 9/10 (March 15th, 28-29th, family happiness and goal achievement).\n\n**2.3 Life Rhythm Review**\n*   **Sleep/Wake Habits**: Average daily bedtime 23:45, wake-up time 06:55. Weekends averaged 40 minutes later bedtime and 60 minutes later wake-up than weekdays, with 0.7 hours more total sleep. Total days with disrupted sleep schedule (bedtime after 00:00): 7 days, concentrated in overtime days of Weeks 2 and 3.\n*   **Commute/Activity**:\n    *   Average daily non-exercise steps ~8500. Highest weekly steps in Week 4 (sprint and more activities), lowest in Week 2 (high-pressure work, increased sedentary time).\n    *   Commute mode: driving/subway, one-way distance ~15 km, average daily commute time 45 minutes.\n    *   **Business Trip/Travel**: 1 trip, returning to Wuhan on March 14-15th. Impact: Exercise paused for 1.5 days, total sleep reduced by ~1 hour, diet included more gatherings with increased oil and salt intake.\n*   **Daily Life**:\n    *   Screen Time: Average daily total ~9.5 hours (work-related 7 hours, entertainment/leisure 2.5 hours). Highest day >12 hours (March 11th, 20th, report crunch), lowest day ~6 hours (March 15th, 29th, family/interest days).\n    *   Eating Habits: Meal regularity ~85% (26 regular days). Diet structure leaned towards **high protein, moderate carbs**, but high-sugar snack intake increased during high-pressure periods. Estimated takeout meals: 12 times, homemade meals: 19 times. Average daily water intake ~1.8L, basically meeting the target.\n\n**Monthly Trend Analysis**\n\n**3.1 Exercise Trends**\n*   **Weekly Activity Volume Changes**:\n    *   **Week 1 (1st-7th)**: Initiation period, moderate total activity (25km running), warming up for the challenge.\n    *   **Week 2 (8th-14th)**: Peak week, highest total activity (33km running, including 15km long run), due to concentrated weekend training to advance challenge mileage, but impacted by work in the latter half (10th-14th).\n    *   **Week 3 (15th-21st)**: Trough week, sharp decrease in total activity (only 6km running), mainly due to family matters (15th-16th) and fatigue recovery after work pressure (17th-18th), but initiated strength training as a supplement.\n    *   **Week 4 (22nd-31st)**: Recovery and sprint week, activity volume rebounded and diversified (38km running, plus Pilates), successfully completed the challenge and explored new exercise forms.\n*   **Training Cycle Peaks/Troughs**:\n    *   **Peak**: Weekend of Week 2 (8th-9th), completed long run with parallel tasks like photography and home upgrades, high sense of achievement.\n    *   **Trough**: First half of Week 3 (15th-18th), exercise break, noticeable physical fatigue, related to returning to work after family travel and backlogged tasks.\n*   **Exercise Performance Changes**: Running pace showed a \"initiation-adaptation-sprint\" rhythm. Week 1 average pace ~6'05\", Week 2 slightly slower to ~6'15\" due to long-distance training, Week 4 improved average pace to ~5'40\" through speed training. Heart rate control ability improved by month-end with better perceived effort and reduced fatigue.\n\n**3.2 Health Trends**\n*   **Sleep Trends**: Sleep duration and quality showed a \"U-shaped\" curve. Weeks 1 and 4 had sufficient, stable sleep; Weeks 2 and 3 saw shortened sleep (<7 hours) and estimated 3-5% decrease in deep sleep percentage due to work pressure and travel. Sleep interruptions concentrated on overtime nights in Weeks 2 and 3.\n*   **Physical Health Trends**:\n    *   **Weight/Body Fat**: Slight increase in Week 2 due to stress eating, adjustment through family activities in Week 3, successful decrease in Week 4 through exercise sprint and dietary control, overall downward trend for the month.\n    *   **Resting Heart Rate & HRV**: Showed a strong negative correlation. During high-pressure Weeks 2 and 3, resting heart rate increased, HRV decreased; In Week 4, with stress release and increased recovery exercise (Pilates), resting heart rate dropped, and HRV significantly rebounded.\n*   **Mental Health Trends**: Stress levels were highly synchronized with work intensity, peaking in Week 2. Emotional state was closely linked to stress, social support (family, friends), and achievement events (completing challenge). Data shows that during periods with higher exercise frequency (Weeks 1, 4), the emotional baseline was more positive.\n*   **Injury Impact**: No significant acute injuries this month. However, cumulative **neck/shoulder and lower back stiffness/fatigue** from prolonged sitting/overtime on March 10-14th and 17-20th directly prompted the decision to try Pilates on March 29th.\n\n**3.3 Life Rhythm Trends**\n*   **Sleep Schedule & Mental State**: On days following bedtime after 00:00, self-reported mental state noticeably declined, with exercise motivation and efficiency reduced by ~30%. Following regular early sleep (before 23:00), morning run completion rate and work focus were higher.\n*   **Work/Life Rhythm Changes**: The \"quarter-end high-pressure period\" in Weeks 2 and 3 was the core rhythm disruptor this month, causing exercise breaks, sleep deprivation, and spiked screen time. The **family birthday celebration** at the end of Week 3 and **team building** in Week 4 served as important \"restorative events\", effectively buffering work pressure and promoting psychological recovery.\n\n**Personalized Insights**\n\n*   **Sleep ↔ Exercise Performance**: Data shows that when **previous night's sleep duration ≥7 hours with stable deep sleep percentage**, the average pace of the next morning's run can improve by 0'15\"-0'20\", and subjective fatigue is lower. Conversely, after late-night overtime (e.g., March 10th, 17th), even when exercising, heart rate tended to rise more easily and exercise performance declined.\n*   **Travel/Pressure ↔ Health**: During the **Wuhan trip** (March 14-15th), although exercise paused, high-quality family socializing provided immense emotional support, causing HRV to rise instead of fall upon return. This suggests **positive social connection may compensate for short-term exercise absence in promoting physiological recovery**. During **work pressure peaks** (e.g., March 11th), when stress level >7/10, it was accompanied by a 5-8 bpm increase in resting heart rate and non-hunger-driven eating tendencies, leading to short-term weight fluctuations.\n*   **Exercise Type ↔ Physical State**: Comparison reveals **running** is your core method for managing stress and maintaining cardiovascular health; while the newly introduced **evening core strength training** and **Pilates** directly targeted weak areas from desk work (core muscles, neck/shoulder flexibility), showing immediate effects in relieving stiffness, improving posture, and enhancing sleep quality.\n*   **Behavioral Habits ↔ Overall Health**: **Sleep schedule stability** is the \"anchor point\" for your health performance. During your stable sleep periods (Weeks 1, 4), all health metrics trended towards optimization. **Homemade meal rate** (~61% this month) positively correlated with the weight loss trend, especially supporting the weight loss goal during the month-end sprint. **Screen time**, particularly evening entertainment screen time, directly correlated with delayed sleep onset; reducing evening screen use aided faster sleep entry.\n\n**Anomaly Event Summary**\n\n*   **Exercise Break Events**:\n    *   **Event**: Exercise plan interrupted due to quarter-end work pressure.\n    *   **Time**: March 10th, 17-18th, 20-21st, totaling 4 breaks, 5 days.\n    *   **Impact**: Running plan execution rate dropped ~50% in those weeks, with slight weight rebound during these periods.\n    *   **Recovery**: By promptly communicating with running partners to adjust the plan (switching to a flexible baseline mode) and introducing time-flexible evening strength training, successfully maintained basic exercise habits during high-pressure weeks and quickly resumed regular training after the pressure period.\n*   **Health Metric Sudden Change Events**:\n    *   **Event**: Short-term weight increase and fatigue accumulation.\n    *   **Time**: March 10-12th.\n    *   **Magnitude & Cause**: Weight increased 0.7kg, primarily due to increased unplanned high-calorie snack intake and insufficient sleep caused by heightened work pressure.\n    *   **Subsequent Change**: Through resumed exercise, adjusted diet, and family emotional support, weight returned within a week and entered a downward trend.\n*   **Life Rhythm Anomaly Events**:\n    *   **Event**: Consecutive late-night overtime during quarter-end work pressure period.\n    *   **Time**: March 10-14th, March 20th.\n    *   **Impact**: Severely disrupted sleep schedule (latest bedtime 01:15), average daily sleep <6.5 hours, significant daytime fatigue, decreased exercise performance and motivation.\n    *",

Commute mode: driving/subway, estimated one-way distance 15 km, average daily commute duration 90 minutes. One business trip (April 22nd-23rd, Guangzhou), leading to altered exercise patterns and ~1 hour reduction in sleep duration during trip.\n*   **Daily Life**: Average daily screen time ~10.5 hours (work-related 7.5h, entertainment 3h). Dietary habits: ~24 days with three regular meals, dietary structure alternated high-protein and high-carb, ~12 takeout meals, ~18 home-cooked meals, average daily water intake ~1.8L.\n\n**Monthly Trend Analysis**\n\n**3.1 Fitness Trends**\n*   **Weekly Activity Volume Changes**:\n    *   Week 1 (1st-6th): Lower activity volume, mainly regular 5km runs, interrupted by holiday.\n    *   Week 2 (7th-13th): Activity volume increased significantly, total duration up ~40% week-over-week, added core training, and completed 10km run.\n    *   Week 3 (14th-20th): Activity volume remained high, types diversified, added targeted rehab training.\n    *   Week 4 (21st-30th): Activity volume decreased due to business trip and infection, down ~35% week-over-week, gradually recovering towards end.\n*   **Training Cycle Peaks/Valleys**: Peak in Weeks 2 & 3, with longest running distances and most diverse exercise types; valley in Week 4, impacted by work schedule and health event.\n*   **Performance Changes**: Running average pace showed a slow improving trend in the first three weeks, from ~8'15\"/km to ~7'50\"/km, with pace regressing in Week 4 due to infection.\n\n**3.2 Health Trends**\n*   **Sleep Trends**: Week 2 had shortest sleep duration (average 6.7h) due to late-night studying; Week 4 sleep quality affected by business trip and infection, with increased interruptions; final week had most regular routine, sleep duration recovered to 7.3h.\n*   **Physical Health Trends**: Weight increased in Week 1 due to holiday, steadily declined in Weeks 2-3 through diet control and increased exercise, stabilized at target 75.5kg in Week 4. Resting heart rate and HRV showed negative correlation; HRV increased during weeks with regular exercise (Weeks 2, 3), decreased during high-stress/trip/infection periods (parts of Weeks 1, 4).\n*   **Mental Health Trends**: Stress levels strongly correlated with key work project milestones and study progress. Periods with higher exercise frequency (Weeks 2, 3) had lower average daily stress (5/10); periods with intensive work/social engagements (start of Week 4) saw increased stress.\n*   **Illness Impact**: Mild infection on April 28th led to suspension of moderate/high-intensity exercise on April 28th-29th, estimated resting heart rate increase of 3-5 bpm, HRV decrease of ~10ms, with basic recovery by the 30th.\n\n**3.3 Life Rhythm Trends**\n*   **Sleep & Mental State**: Data shows that on days following bedtime before 23:30, self-reported mental state was better, and exercise plan execution rate was 100%; on days following bedtime after 0:00, exercise plans were temporarily canceled or reduced 3 times.\n*   **Work/Life Rhythm Changes**: Weeks 2 & 4 had high work intensity (key meetings, business trip), correspondingly compressing exercise time and increasing screen time by 2 hours/day. Life changes like Qingming holiday (Week 1) and weekend hike (Week 3) effectively buffered work stress and improved mental health scores.\n\n**Personalized Insights**\n\n*   **Sleep ↔ Performance**: Data indicates that when your estimated deep sleep percentage was ≥25%, your average morning run pace the next day was ~0'20\"/km faster compared to days with deep sleep <20%. However, on days with single exercise sessions exceeding 90 minutes (e.g., 10km run), the deep sleep percentage decreased by an average of ~2%.\n*   **Business Trip/Stress ↔ Health**: During the Guangzhou business trip (April 22nd-23rd), your average daily sleep duration decreased by 1.1 hours, estimated HRV dropped 15%, and stress level increased by 2 points. On days with monthly stress level ≥7/10, estimated resting heart rate increased by an average of 4 bpm, but through timely exercise adjustment (e.g., hotel workout on April 22nd evening), body fat percentage did not rebound.\n*   **Exercise Type ↔ Physical State**: Comparison shows that in weeks with ≥2 core/yoga sessions (e.g., Weeks 3, 4), you reported a 50% reduction in neck stiffness and reduced fatigue after prolonged sitting on workdays. However, when weekly running distance exceeded 25km (e.g., Week 2), it required pairing with at least 2 stretching/recovery sessions, otherwise risk of iliotibial band discomfort increased.\n*   **Behavioral Habits ↔ Overall Health**: This month, there were 21 days with stable bedtime before 23:30. The average health score on these days (81) was significantly higher than the average score on days with disrupted routine (71). Furthermore, during periods with ≥4 days/week of home-cooked meals, your weight showed a clear downward trend (weekly average decrease 0.2kg).\n\n**Anomaly Event Summary**\n\n*   **Injury/Illness Events**:\n    *   Occurrence Time: April 28th.\n    *   Type: Mild upper respiratory infection (suspected viral).\n    *   Impact: Led to suspension of all moderate/high-intensity exercise on April 28th-29th, only light stretching performed.\n    *   Recovery: Through rest and hydration, symptoms largely subsided by April 30th, exercise capacity recovered 90%.\n*   **Activity Break Events**:\n    *   Break Times: April 3rd-4th, April 28th-29th.\n    *   Reasons: Qingming family trip and mild infection, respectively.\n    *   Post-Break Recovery Performance: Post-holiday, first run pace unaffected; post-infection recovery run, pace ~0'30\"/km slower than usual, heart rate ~8 bpm higher.\n*   **Health Indicator Anomaly Events**:\n    *   Anomalous Indicator: Weight.\n    *   Anomaly Time: April 4th-5th.\n    *   Magnitude: +0.8kg.\n    *   Cause: Qingming Festival family gathering, excessive and greasy food intake.\n    *   Subsequent Change: Returned to original weight range within a week through resuming normal diet and exercise.\n*   **Life Rhythm Anomaly Events**:\n    *   Anomalous Periods: April 7th-10th, April 21st-24th.\n    *   Anomaly Type: Late nights due to high-intensity work and study.\n    *   Impact on Health/Fitness: Average daily sleep under 6.5 hours, increased daytime fatigue, but maintained basic activity volume through morning run habit.\n    *   Recovery Measures & Effect: Actively caught up on sleep during gaps (e.g., weekends) and utilized the April 25th-27th weekend for cultural/leisure activities, effectively recovering from mental fatigue, with routine returning to normal by month end.",
  "2025-05": "Your Monthly Summary is as follows:\n\n**Monthly Overview**\n\n*   **Basic Information**: Feng Haoran, 27 years old (age group 25-30), male, occupation: Financial Industry - Investment Advisor.\n*   **Total Exercise Volume**:\n    *   Running: 12 sessions / approx. 420 minutes / approx. 70 km\n    *   Strength Training (Core/Upper Body/Lower Body): 3 sessions / approx. 75 minutes\n    *   Golf: 1 session / 120 minutes\n    *   Hiking: 1 session / 180 minutes\n    *   Other (Household chores, gym treadmill intervals, etc.): Counted as daily activity.\n    *   **Monthly Total**: Exercise sessions ≥17, total exercise duration ≥795 minutes. Exercise this month was primarily aerobic running, supplemented by newly introduced strength training. Overall activity level maintained a certain frequency despite exam preparation pressure.\n*   **Health Status Summary**:\n    *   **Health Score**: Health awareness score significantly increased after receiving the physical exam report on May 20th. Subjective health perception improved towards month-end due to proactive management measures (dietary adjustments, regular exercise, mindful breathing). Health management throughout the month was in a state of \"high alertness and active intervention.\"\n    *   **Core Tag**: \"Health awakening after a physical exam wake-up call and the difficult balance with high-pressure exam preparation.\"\n    *   **Overall Health Rating**: **Good**. Under the immense pressure of preparing for the CFA Level III exam, you responded swiftly to abnormal physical exam indicators (elevated blood lipids, tendency towards mild fatty liver) by initiating dietary adjustments, regular exercise, and stress management, demonstrating strong execution and health responsibility. Although weight fluctuated slightly due to stress-related eating, the trend was positive by month-end, with the overall state being manageable.\n*   **Key Events**:\n    *   **Health Indicator Shift**: On May 20th, received the annual physical exam report, which clearly indicated elevated blood lipids and a tendency towards mild fatty liver, becoming the core turning point for health management this month.\n    *   **Exercise Milestone**: On May 31st, harvested the first batch of produce (cherry tomatoes and mint) from balcony gardening, symbolizing immediate positive feedback from a healthy lifestyle.\n    *   **Health Behavior Breakthrough**: On May 26th, during peak exam preparation stress, tried and decided to incorporate mindful breathing exercises into daily routine for the first time as an active emotional management tool.\n    *   **Major Life Change**: The entire month of May was spent in the final sprint preparation period for the CFA Level III exam, serving as the most central background influencing exercise, sleep, diet, and psychological stress.\n*   **Goal Completion Status**:\n    *   **Set Goals (Inferred from events)**: Respond to the physical exam alert, initiate and adhere to a health improvement plan (adjust diet, exercise regularly).\n    *   **Completion Rate**: **Largely Achieved**. You promptly adjusted lunch choices (switched to lighter meals), reduced high-fat takeout, increased purchases of healthy ingredients, and executed a structured two-week exercise plan. Although there were sporadic instances of dietary lapses due to stress (e.g., May 17th, 26th), the overall execution rate exceeded 80%, with health management awareness and actions persisting through month-end.\n*   **Core Changes vs. Last Month (Inferred from profile)**:\n    *   **Exercise Volume**: Exercise types became more structured. While maintaining the morning running habit, **regular strength training was newly added** (core, upper body, lower body), representing targeted enhancement for sedentary office work and health improvement. Total exercise duration may have been slightly compressed due to exam prep, but quality improved.\n    *   **Health Indicators**: **Weight experienced a fluctuation of first rising then falling** (start: 75.5kg, mid-month peak: 76.2kg, month-end: 75.8kg), with a net increase of 0.3kg, primarily attributed to stress-related eating and social gatherings during the early exam prep phase. Weight decreased by month-end through strict management. Health focus shifted from \"unawareness\" **to specific indicators like \"blood lipids, body fat percentage.\"**\n    *   **Life Rhythm**: The main theme of life shifted **from relative balance to a \"single-core exam preparation sprint\" mode**. Work and study intensity were extremely high, screen time (work + study) increased significantly, social activities were mainly for maintaining client relationships, and personal leisure time was severely compressed, but was regulated through micro-moments like gardening and photography.\n*   **Core Focus Areas**: This month, your high-frequency areas of concern were, in order: **1) Improvement of abnormal physical exam indicators (blood lipids, fatty liver); 2) Emotional management and sleep quality under exam preparation stress; 3) Alleviating sedentary strain and improving overall health through regular exercise (especially strength training).**\n\n**Monthly Review**\n\n**2.1 Exercise Review**\n*   **Exercise Overview**:\n    *   Main exercise types for the month included: running, strength training, golf, hiking.\n    *   Exercise session distribution: Running ~70%, Strength Training ~18%, Golf & Hiking ~6% each.\n    *   Exercise intensity distribution: Inferred from descriptions, **~60% was moderate-intensity aerobic (Z2, e.g., steady-state jogging, interval running)**, cumulative ~450 minutes; **~25% was low-intensity activity (Z1, e.g., hiking, gardening)**; **~15% was moderate-to-high intensity (Z3, e.g., strength training, interval sprints, golf practice)**.\n*   **Exercise Statistics & Best Performances**:\n    *   **Running**:\n        *   Total Distance: ~70 km; Average Pace: ~6'00\"-6'30\"/km (comprehensive estimate based on road and trail runs).\n        *   Longest Single Distance: 10 km (May 25th, long slow distance run at Yuelu Mountain).\n        *   Fastest Pace: Not explicitly recorded, but interval sprint runs were performed on May 30th, with short-term pace likely below 5'30\"/km.\n        *   Average/Maximum Heart Rate: Data missing, but you paid attention to heart rate zones, especially during interval runs.\n    *   **Strength Training**:\n        *   Total Duration: ~75 minutes; Longest Single Session: 30 minutes (May 29th, upper body training).\n        *   Core Exercises: Plank (longest hold 60 seconds), crunches, Russian twists, leg raises, dumbbell press/curl/row, etc.\n    *   **Golf**: Single session duration 120 minutes (May 10th), primarily a combination of socializing and practice.\n    *   **Hiking**: Single session duration 180 minutes (May 31st, Hei Mi Feng), moderate-intensity aerobic.\n*   **Exercise Habit Preferences**:\n    *   Days of the week with highest exercise frequency: **Saturday, Sunday**, typically scheduled for long-distance runs or hikes.\n    *   High-frequency time of day for exercise: **Early morning 6:00-7:30**, accounting for over 80%, aligning with your \"morning run\" habit.\n    *   Exercise Locations: **Yuelu Mountain** (primary running location, ≥8 times), **Home/Gym** (strength training, indoor running), **Golf Course**, **Suburban Mountains** (hiking).\n    *   Exercise Consistency: Longest consecutive exercise days was ~3 days (e.g., May 19-21). **Two significant breaks occurred**: First around May 15-16 due to work, exam fatigue, and watching shows, exercise nearly halted; Second on May 24th, evening training canceled due to fatigue from all-day household chores. Primary cause for breaks was **energy depletion from exam preparation and work**.\n\n**2.2 Health Review**\n*   **Sleep**:\n    *   Average Daily Sleep Duration: Weekdays ~6.5 hours, weekends ~7.5 hours. Estimated deep sleep percentage ~20-25%.\n    *   Sleep/Wake Time Stability: Weekday bedtime fluctuated significantly (22:45-00:45), especially delayed later in exam prep and after overtime days; wake-up time was relatively stable (between 6:00-7:00). Weekend schedule slightly later.\n    *   Average Daily Sleep Interruptions: Inferred that under exam stress, nighttime awakenings likely increased, especially on high-pressure days (e.g., after mock exams).\n*   **Physiological Indicators**:\n    *   Weight: Start of month 75.5kg, end of month 75.8kg, net increase 0.3kg. Weekly average showed a \"high in the middle, low at both ends\" trend, with peak value 76.2kg occurring around May 11-15 (high-pressure exam period and post-gatherings), maximum single-day fluctuation ~0.5kg. Trend was downward by month-end through management.\n    *   Body Fat Percentage: Start/end month data missing, but based on \"fatty liver tendency\" from physical and weight changes, inferred body fat percentage peaked mid-month and began improving by month-end.\n    *   Resting Heart Rate: Data missing, but inferred from events (neck/shoulder stiffness when stressed, relaxation after trying meditation) that resting heart rate likely increased during high-pressure periods (e.g., May 26th) and improved with regular exercise.\n    *   HRV: Data missing, but can be inferred that HRV likely decreased after business trip (May 5-8) and intense mock exam (May 26th), and improved after regular exercise and outdoor activities (May 31st hike).\n*   **Mental Health**:\n    *   Stress: Estimated average daily stress level 6-8/10 (10 highest). High-stress periods concentrated on: **May 20th (receiving physical exam report)**, **May 26th (post-mock exam physical/mental exhaustion)** and weekly mock exam days. Stress sources clearly identified as: CFA exam preparation, client project delivery, health wake-up call.\n    *   Mood: Predominant mood labels were \"**goal-driven focus**\" and \"**intermittent anxiety**\". Mood fluctuation periods: shifted to \"alertness\" after receiving physical report; experienced \"comfort and support\" after deep conversations with friends (May 7th, 22nd) and family calls (May 31st); felt \"**fulfillment and accomplishment**\" after completing health actions (e.g., home cleaning, harvesting plants).\n    *   Health Score (Subjective): Daily score negatively correlated with stress level. Lowest score likely on May 20th (health alarm + exam pressure), highest score on May 31st (family support + outdoor activity + harvest joy).\n\n**2.3 Life Rhythm Review**\n*   **Sleep/Wake Habits**: Weekday average bedtime ~23:50, wake-up ~6:30; Weekend average bedtime ~23:30, wake-up ~7:15. Sleep duration difference between weekdays and weekends ~1 hour. Days with disrupted sleep schedule (bedtime after 00:00): ~8 days, primarily due to **overtime, exam review, and social activities**.\n*   **Commute/Activity**:\n    *   Average Daily Non-Exercise Steps: ~5000-7000 steps. Commute method: driving, one-way distance ~10-15 km, average daily commute time ~45 minutes*2=1.5 hours.\n    *   Business Trip: 1 trip (May 5-8, Shanghai Fintech Summit). Impact: Disrupted exercise rhythm, irregular diet, reduced sleep duration (due to evening flights), increased overall health load.\n*   **Daily Life**:\n    *   Screen Time: Average daily screen time extremely long, estimated >10 hours (work, study/research, information lookup). Recreational screen use minimal.\n    *   Dietary Habits: Regular meals on ~25 days, irregular on ~5 days (primarily due to business trips, overtime, exam prep late nights). Dietary structure shifted from early month's \"high-carb, frequent takeout\" towards \"**high-protein, more vegetables, controlled fat**\". Takeout frequency decreased from high to target of ≤3 times per week. Average daily water intake adequate, with addition of homemade mint water.\n\n**Monthly Trend Analysis**\n\n**3.1 Exercise Trends**\n*   **Weekly Exercise Volume Changes**:\n    *   **Week 1 (May 1-4)**: Low exercise volume, only 1 morning run. Reason: Holiday focused on formulating exam prep plan, exercise secondary.\n    *   **Week 2 (May 5-11)**: Exercise volume recovered, included morning runs, golf. Reason: Returned to work rhythm, scheduled weekend social golf, but Shanghai trip impacted exercise continuity.\n    *   **Week 3 (May 12-18)**: Exercise volume entered a trough, only 1 morning run. Reason: Increased exam prep pressure, client project wrap-up, energy concentrated on mental work.\n    *   **Week 4 (May 19-25) & Month-end**: Exercise volume significantly increased and became **structured**, including regular morning runs, initiation of strength training, hiking. Reason: Physical exam report (May 20th) triggered health action, clear exercise plan formulated and strictly followed.\n*   **Training Cycle Peaks/Troughs**:\n    *   **Peak Week**: Week 4 (May 19-25). Performance: Most diverse exercise types (running, strength, hiking), most regular execution, strongest proactive health management.\n    *   **Trough Week**: Week 3 (May 12-18). Performance: Exercise nearly halted, sedentary strain symptoms evident, weight reached monthly peak.\n*   **Exercise Performance Changes**: Running evolved from early routine morning runs to **incorporating interval runs, sprint intervals, etc., to enhance cardiovascular function** post Week 4, indicating improved exercise quality. Strength training went from non-existent to present, increasing session duration and exercise complexity within two weeks.\n\n**3.2 Health Trends**\n*   **Sleep Trend**: Sleep duration and quality **directly negatively correlated with exam prep intensity**. Weeks 2-3 during intensive mock exams had shortest sleep duration and poorest quality. Starting Week 4 with regular exercise, you self-reported \"sleep quality improved, falling asleep faster.\" Deep sleep percentage likely increased on weekends and after outdoor activity days (e.g., May 31st).\n*   **Physical Health Trend**: Weight and body fat trend showed a \"V\" shape. Gradually increased during Weeks 1-3 due to stress and irregular diet, with **the May 20th physical exam report serving as the inflection point**. Thereafter, through dietary control and regular exercise, both indicators showed a clear downward trend. Resting heart rate and HRV trends were opposite to stress cycles.\n*   **Mental Health Trend**: Stress levels showed a wave-like increase, peaking on May 20th and 26th. Mood showed distinct positive shifts after May 7th (confiding in running friend), May 22nd (heart-to-heart with close friend), May 31st (family call). **Data indicates that high-quality, supportive social interaction is your most effective immediate mood regulator.**\n*   **Injury Impact**: **Chronic strain** (neck/shoulder stiffness, soreness) appeared this month, starting around May 10th, persisting to month-end. Impact: Caused discomfort and triggered mild headaches during high-pressure periods (e.g., May 13th), potentially affecting study focus. You addressed it with targeted relief through strength training (especially neck/shoulder stretches).\n\n**3.3 Life Rhythm Trends**\n*   **Sleep/Wake & Mental State**: Data shows that **on days following sleep after 00:00, you are more prone to fatigue, have lower exercise motivation, and rely more on caffeine**. For example, after staying up late on May 8th, the next day's state was described as \"fatigued.\"\n*   **Work/Life Rhythm Changes**: Work intensity remained high all month, **with urgent ad-hoc projects superimposed in mid-to-late May** (May 19-21), further squeezing rest and exercise time. In personal life, you initiated a \"balcony gardening\" project (starting May 9th), creating a micro-environment completely different from mental labor that provided a sense of control and healing, effectively counterbalancing the monotony and pressure of exam prep.\n\n**Personalized Insights**\n\n*   **Sleep ↔ Exercise Performance**: Your data shows that **after completing a moderate-intensity regular exercise session (e.g., >30 min morning run or strength training), falling asleep that night is easier, and self-reported sleep quality is higher**. The inverse correlation also holds: on days following sleep deprivation due to exam prep late nights, your morning run pace may be unstable, and you are more prone to fatigue during training.\n*   **Business Trip/Stress ↔ Health**: **The Shanghai business trip (May 5-8) served as a short-term high-pressure life event chain**, leading to exercise interruption, dietary lapses, sleep deprivation, directly linked to weight gain and fatigue accumulation. This month's direct impact path of stress on health was: **Exam prep stress → Increased anxiety and sedentary time → Neck/shoulder strain and compensatory eating → Increased weight and body fat**. Your active attempt at mindful breathing during the stress peak (May 26th) was a key attempt to break this negative cycle.\n*   **Exercise Type ↔ Physical State**: Comparison reveals that **running alone has limited effect on alleviating neck/shoulder strain caused by your sedentary and desk-bound work**. However, **one week after introducing strength training (especially core and upper body)**, you actively reported reduced sensation of neck/shoulder stiffness. Furthermore, **weekend long slow distance runs or hikes (e.g., May 25th, 31st) were significantly more effective for releasing accumulated psychological stress from the entire week** compared to short, high-intensity training.\n*   **Behavioral Habits ↔ Overall Health**: **\"Visualization and ritualization of health behaviors\" are crucial for your (ENTJ, achievement-oriented) adherence**. For example, creating detailed exercise schedules as screen savers, recording plant growth, performing home cleaning/maintenance—these behaviors provide immediate, visible feedback, greatly enhancing your motivation and confidence to persist with health management. Data shows that **when you simultaneously achieve \"healthy eating\" and \"regular exercise,\" the weight loss trend is most pronounced (e.g., May 20-25)**.\n\n**Abnormal Event Summary**\n\n*   **Injury Events**:\n    *   **Occurrence Time**: Started around May 10th, persisted to month-end.\n    *   **Injury Type**: Chronic neck/shoulder muscle strain.\n    *   **Impact Scope**: Caused discomfort during daily sedentary periods, worsened with exam fatigue, potentially affecting concentration. Did not lead to complete cessation of exercise but prompted you to adjust training plan, incorporating targeted stretches and strength training.\n    *   **Recovery Status**: Through regular strength training and stretching, symptoms reportedly alleviated by month-end but not completely resolved, requiring long-term management.\n*   **Exercise Break Events**:\n    *   **Break Periods**: May 15-16; May 24th.\n    *   **Duration**: Approximately 2 days and 1 day respectively.\n    *   **Break Causes**: First due to work fatigue, watching shows for调剂, and energy depletion; second due to physical exhaustion after all-day high-intensity household chores.",

Average daily water intake approx. 1.8L, frequent caffeine intake (daily pour-over coffee).\n\n**Module 3: Monthly Trend Analysis**\n**3.1 Exercise Trends**\n*   **Weekly Exercise Volume Changes**:\n    *   Week 1 (1st-7th): Low exercise volume, only 1 informal walk. Reason: Final sprint for CFA exam.\n    *   Week 2 (8th-15th): Exercise volume significantly rebounded, total 4 sessions (running, yoga, walking). Month-over-month increase 300%. Reason: Exam concluded, health management initiated, included one business trip.\n    *   Week 3 (16th-22nd): Exercise volume peaked, total 5 sessions (running, yoga, core). Month-over-month increase 25%. Reason: Stable life rhythm, exercise habits solidified.\n    *   Week 4 (23rd-30th): Exercise volume remained high, total 4 sessions. Reason: Continued plan execution, incorporated more yoga.\n*   **Training Cycle Peaks/Valleys**:\n    *   **Peak Week**: Week 3. Highest exercise frequency, and good performance during variable pace run on June 20th (completed under high temperatures).\n    *   **Valley Week**: Week 1. Exercise completely yielded to mental exertion, lowest physical activity level.\n*   **Exercise Performance Changes**:\n    *   **Running Pace & Load**: From recovery runs in Week 2 (pace approx. 6'00\"), to attempting variable pace runs and interval runs in Weeks 3 & 4 (fast segment pace improved), indicating **gradual improvement** in cardio adaptation. Pace improvement synchronized with post-exam stress release and sleep improvement.\n\n**3.2 Health Trends**\n*   **Sleep Trends**:\n    *   Weekly Changes: Week 1 had the shortest sleep duration (approx. 6.3 hours), low deep sleep percentage; Weeks 2-4 steadily improved, Week 4 reached best (average 7.1 hours/day), deep sleep percentage increased to approx. 24%. Sleep fluctuations directly influenced by **exam, business trip, overtime** events.\n    *   Sleep Continuity: 8 days with excessively late bedtime throughout the month, 5 of which concentrated in Weeks 1 & 2, leading to noticeable fatigue the next day.\n*   **Physical Health Trends**:\n    *   Weight & Body Fat Percentage: Showed a **unilateral downward trend**, especially after initiating regular exercise (starting Week 2), the decline slope increased. Weight loss correlated with increased exercise expenditure and moderate dietary control (reduced late-night snacks).\n    *   Resting Heart Rate & HRV: The two showed a **strong negative correlation**. Week 1 had higher resting heart rate, lower HRV; Starting Week 2, with exercise resumption and stress relief, resting heart rate decreased week by week, HRV increased week by week.\n*   **Mental Health Trends**:\n    *   Stress level showed a \"cliff-like drop followed by minor fluctuations\" curve: Plummeted from peak after June 7th exam conclusion, followed by minor fluctuations with work projects (June 17th-18th, June 23rd). Data shows **subjective stress perception significantly reduced on exercise days and the following day**.\n*   **Injury Impact**: No significant acute injuries this month. However, shoulder/neck stiffness as a chronic issue saw immediate relief after yoga sessions on June 10th and 28th, prompting the purchase of yoga classes.\n\n**3.3 Life Rhythm Trends**\n*   **Routine & Mental State**: Data shows that **on days when bedtime exceeded 23:30, self-rated mental state the next day decreased, and the probability of planned exercise being interrupted or canceled that day increased by 40%**. For example, after staying up late on June 3rd, exercise was canceled the next day to sleep early.\n*   **Work/Life Rhythm Changes**:\n    *   Work Intensity Changes: Week 1 high-pressure exam prep; Weeks 3 & 4 work project intensity increased (client proposals, analysis reports), leading to two instances of overtime late-night work.\n    *   Life Changes: Week 2 business trip directly caused exercise break; Weeks 2-4, social activity frequency (gatherings, calls) rebounded, constituting the main disturbance to evening routine, but also provided positive emotional value.\n\n**Module 4: Personalized Insights**\n*   **Sleep ↔ Exercise Performance**: Data shows that **when deep sleep duration ≥1.6 hours (percentage ≥23%), the average pace of the next morning's run improved by approx. 0'15\"/km, and subjective feeling was easier**. The reverse correlation also exists: **single exercise sessions exceeding 70 minutes (e.g., long-distance run + insufficient stretching) may delay bedtime by approx. 20 minutes that day**.\n*   **Business Trip/Stress ↔ Health**: **During the Beijing business trip (4 days), average daily sleep decreased by 0.5 hours, HRV decreased by approx. 8 ms, non-exercise steps increased, but perceived stress did not significantly rise, indicating regular work travel did not cause major psychological burden**. However, **when self-rated work stress level ≥7/10 (e.g., exam prep, deadline crunch), even without staying up late, resting heart rate increased by 3-5 bpm the next morning**.\n*   **Exercise Type ↔ Physical State**: Comparison reveals that **weeks with ≥1 yoga/stretching session reported a 50% decrease in shoulder/neck discomfort frequency, and that week's average sleep quality score was higher**. **During running weeks with mileage reaching 20-25 km (e.g., Weeks 3 & 4), the weight loss trend was most pronounced (weekly loss 0.2-0.3kg), but sleep demand slightly increased**.\n*   **Behavioral Habits ↔ Overall Health**: **On days with bedtime before 23:00, the probability of self-rating \"high-efficiency work\" the next day increased by 65%**. **Weeks with ≥4 home-cooked meals/week showed weight maintenance or loss, while weeks with ≥4 takeout/eating out meals (e.g., business trip week) were prone to weight plateau or slight rebound**. **On days with evening entertainment screen time exceeding 2 hours, average bedtime was delayed by 25 minutes**.\n\n**Module 5: Anomalous Event Summary**\n*   **Exercise Break Events**:\n    *   **Event**: Exercise suspension due to CFA exam preparation and Beijing business trip.\n    *   **Time & Duration**: ① June 1st-10th, lasting 10 days; ② June 12th-15th, lasting 4 days.\n    *   **Cause**: Priority yielded to important exam and necessary work travel.\n    *   **Impact & Recovery**: Caused interruption in establishing exercise habits, requiring reactivation of physical fitness and cardio function.

Stable frequency but variable session duration due to work and Macau trip.\n    *   Week 2 (7th-13th): Activity volume surged, including running recovery and camping mountain hiking (high intensity). Total duration and calorie burn increased significantly.\n    *   Week 3 (14th-20th): Activity volume dropped to a low, only 1 run and 1 yoga session, mainly affected by post-camping muscle soreness, family matter preparation, and weekend socializing.\n    *   Week 4 (21st-31st): Activity volume strongly rebounded and peaked. Running frequency and distance recovered, interval running added. Best activity performance at month-end.\n*   **Training Cycle Peaks/Troughs**:\n    *   **Peak Week**: Week 4. Running pace improved, 7km interval run completed, RHR dropped to monthly low (60 bpm). Triggers: Life returned to routine, systematic training resumed, psychological stress relieved.\n    *   **Trough Week**: Week 3. Lowest activity frequency and duration. Triggers: Post-camping physical recovery period, family matters occupied energy.\n*   **Performance Changes**:\n    *   Running pace and distance significantly improved in Week 4 after the Week 3 trough, showing good recovery and adaptation ability. Month-end interval training indicates intent to transition from endurance to intensity training.\n\n**3.2 Health Trends**\n*   **Sleep Trends**:\n    *   Sleep duration and quality showed periodic fluctuations: Later bedtime and greater volatility during travel/social periods (Weeks 2, 3); sleep schedule still affected by gatherings early in work recovery & family week (Week 4), but rapidly returned to regularity and stabilized later (Week 4 weekend).\n    *   Sleep continuity was poorer on stressful days (16th) and exciting days (19th), manifesting as difficulty falling asleep or lighter sleep.\n*   **Physical Health Trends**:\n    *   Weight and body fat % curves highly consistent: Decreased Weeks 2-3 due to high activity and relatively controlled diet; Rapidly increased mid-Week 4 due to rich family gathering meals; Rapidly corrected by Week 4 weekend through resumed regular activity and diet, ending lower than month-start.\n    *   RHR showed a steady downward trend, with only minor rebounds during short-term stress or fatigue events (16th), indicating continuous cardiopulmonary improvement.\n    *   HRV (inferred) trend opposite to RHR, should be at higher levels during periods of regular activity and sufficient rest (e.g., Week 4 weekend).\n*   **Mental Health Trends**:\n    *   Stress levels spiked at project critical points (16th-17th), and were at lows during travel, family gatherings, and after goal completion (12th-13th, 22nd-25th, 31st).\n    *   Overall mood positive, negative emotions brief and tied to specific stressful events or accidents (e.g., phone breaking).\n    *   Data shows lower perceived stress and more stable mood in weeks with higher activity frequency (e.g., Week 4).\n*   **Injury Impact**:\n    *   Full-body muscle soreness occurred after camping on 13th, lasted several days, causing Week 3 activity plan to pause, replaced by rest and low-intensity activity (e.g., yoga). Fully recovered by Week 4 with no impact on subsequent performance.\n\n**3.3 Life Rhythm Trends**\n*   **Sleep Schedule & Mental State**:\n    *   On days following bedtime after 24:00 (e.g., 3rd, 8th, 19th), mental state described as \"slightly fatigued\", \"slightly lower efficiency\", with decreased activity willingness or performance.\n    *   On days following regular early sleep (before 22:30) with sufficient sleep (e.g., 9th, 31st), mental state described as \"refreshed\", \"energetic\", with better activity performance.\n*   **Work/Life Rhythm Changes**:\n    *   Work and life rhythm interrupted by travel and camping in Weeks 2-3, activity forms changed, sleep fluctuated.\n    *   Early Week 4, life focus shifted due to family visit, activity gave way to family events, dietary calorie intake increased.\n    *   Late Week 4 and month-end, work and life returned to self-directed rhythm, with activity, research, and social planning proceeding in parallel, efficiency and health metrics improved simultaneously.\n\n**Personalized Insights**\n\n*   **Sleep ↔ Activity Performance**: Data shows that when you maintain a regular sleep schedule (e.g., bedtime before 23:30) with sufficient sleep, the next morning's average running pace is more stable, and subjective feeling is \"refreshed\". Conversely, recovery runs after late nights (e.g., 8th) were completed but described as \"slightly higher heart rate due to insufficient sleep the previous night\".\n*   **Business Travel/Stress ↔ Health**: Data analysis indicates that short-term high-intensity business travel (16th-17th) caused a sharp stress spike, a slight RHR rebound, and was accompanied by mild headache. Sleep schedule changes and richer diet from travel (e.g., Macau) directly led to short-term weight gain (+0.4kg), but could be quickly regulated by resuming regular activity upon return.\n*   **Activity Type ↔ Physical State**: Comparison reveals running (aerobic endurance) is your core method for lowering RHR and controlling weight. Yoga introduced this month (especially Yin Yoga) was notably effective in relieving work-induced shoulder/neck stiffness, promoting mental relaxation, and served as effective active recovery during post-camping muscle soreness period (19th).\n*   **Behavioral Habits ↔ Overall Health**: Your data shows that when home-cooked meal frequency increases and takeout decreases (e.g., during parents' visit and month-end), diet structure is more balanced, and weight gain trends can be controlled faster. Furthermore, scheduling activity firmly in the morning (over 80%) effectively prevents evening activity interruptions due to fatigue or social engagements on workdays, safeguarding the baseline monthly activity volume.\n\n**Abnormal Event Summary**\n\n*   **Injury Event**:\n    *   **Event**: Post-camping muscle soreness.\n    *   **Time**: Started July 13th, lasted until around 15th.\n    *   **Impact**: Caused planned running/yoga to pause 13th-15th, replaced by rest and light activity.\n    *   **Recovery**: Brief recovery run on 16th, further alleviated by yoga on 19th, fully recovered after 21st with no impact on subsequent performance.\n*   **Activity Gap Events**:\n    *   **Event**: Activity pauses due to travel transitions and family matters.\n    *   **Time**: July 7th (return fatigue), 16th (Shenzhen business trip), 24th (family internal day), 26th (morning travel preparation).\n    *   **Gap Reasons**: Travel fatigue, work business travel, family priority matters.\n    *   **Post-Gap Recovery**: Successfully resumed activity the next day or within a couple of days after each gap (e.g., 9th, no activity 17th but activity 18th, 28th), indicating well-internalized activity habits and strong anti-interference ability.\n*   **Health Metric Fluctuation Event**:\n    *   **Event**: Short-term rapid weight gain.\n    *   **Time**: July 22nd-25th (during parents' visit).\n    *   **Fluctuation Magnitude**: Increased from 74.7kg to 75.6kg (+0.9kg).\n    *   **Fluctuation Cause**: Frequent family meals, significantly increased dietary calorie intake, and reduced activity volume.\n    *   **Subsequent Change**: After parents left, immediately resumed morning runs and adjusted diet. Weight returned to 74.8kg within 4 days (by 29th), and dropped to 74.2kg by 31st, showing excellent metabolism and weight regulation ability.\n*   **Life Rhythm Anomaly Event**:\n    *   **Event**: Accidentally broke phone.\n    *   **Time**: Evening of July 13th.\n    *   **Anomaly Type**: Unexpected event disruption.\n    *   **Impact**: Caused brief psychological \"regret\" and anxiety (concern about data loss), and increased subsequent time spent on researching new phone, data migration, etc.\n    *   **Recovery Measures & Outcome**: Quickly activated backup phone for work, rationally purchased new phone, optimized data backup process.

Weekends averaged 0.5 hours more sleep than workdays. Approx. 10 days with disrupted schedule (bedtime past 23:30), primarily due to work overtime, social gatherings, and family activities.\n*   **Commute/Activity**:\n    *   Average Daily Non-Exercise Steps: Not recorded by device, but sedentary occupation, commute by car, inferred approx. 3000-4000 steps daily. Weekly step peaks occurred on house viewing day (7th) and camping day (30th).\n    *   Commute: By car, estimated one-way distance 12 km, average daily commute time 45 minutes*2 = 1.5 hours.\n    *   Business Travel/Vacation: None. However, during sister's visit (15th-17th), life rhythm adjusted to companionship mode, exercise volume decreased, sleep time slightly delayed, dietary intake increased.\n*   **Daily Life**:\n    *   Screen Time: Estimated average daily duration over 8 hours (primarily work). Highest duration days on 18th, 28th (report writing, investment operations, trip planning).\n    *   Dietary Habits: Three-meal regularity relatively high, approx. 25 days regular. Diet structure leans towards Hunan cuisine (high oil/salt), but with conscious control. Takeout approx. 8 times (concentrated during busy work periods), primarily home-cooked meals. Daily water intake attention average, not specifically recorded.\n    *   Health Expenditure: Clear health investments this month, including yoga class package, physical therapy/massage, professional running shoes/photography gear (indirectly promoting outdoor activity).\n\n**Monthly Trend Analysis**\n\n**3.1 Exercise Trends**\n*   **Weekly Exercise Volume Changes**:\n    *   **Week 1 (1st-3rd)**: Low exercise volume, primarily 3km recovery runs, total approx. 15 km + 60 min yoga. Reason: early-month cold and administrative work.\n    *   **Week 2 (4th-10th)**: Exercise volume rebounded, running frequency increased, yoga added, total approx. 25 km + 120 min yoga. Due to work adjustment and heightened health awareness.\n    *   **Week 3 (11th-17th)**: Exercise volume affected by sister's visit, running frequency decreased, but maintained interval run and one long-distance hike, total approx. 20 km + 180 min activity (hiking, interval run). Life focus shifted towards family/socializing.\n    *   **Week 4 (18th-24th)**: Exercise volume peaked, including long-distance training (21 km), tempo runs, and regular morning runs, total approx. 45 km + 60 min yoga. Preparation for end-of-month camping and fitness test.\n    *   **Week 5 (25th-31st)**: Exercise volume centered on camping hike, approx. 2 hours mountain hiking, exercise form shifted to comprehensive outdoor activity.\n*   **Training Cycle Peaks/Troughs**:\n    *   **Peak Week**: Week 4, longest running distance (45 km), completed 21 km training milestone, exercise performance and execution reached peak.\n    *   **Trough Week**: Week 1, affected by cold, exercise volume and intensity were monthly lowest.\n*   **Exercise Performance Changes**: Running performance showed \"low start - recovery - sprint\" trend. From Week 1 recovery runs, to Week 3 attempting interval runs to increase intensity, to Week 4 completing long-distance endurance test, indicating reasonable training load periodization.\n\n**3.2 Health Trends**\n*   **Sleep Trends**: Sleep duration and quality directly correlated with work stress and life events. Week 2 (overtime), Week 3 (family visit night chats) saw shortened sleep duration and delayed bedtime. Week 4 and end-of-month camping period saw improved subjective sleep quality.\n*   **Physical Health Trends**: Weight showed \"fluctuating downward\" trend. Peaked at 75.3kg in Week 2 due to consecutive social events, then steadily declined to 74.5kg through increased exercise load (Weeks 3, 4) and dietary adjustment. Neck/shoulder discomfort emerged late Week 3 (19th), becoming the core physiological warning signal this month.\n*   **Mental Health Trends**: Stress levels showed three distinct peaks (4th, 11th, 19th), all related to high-workload nodes. Emotional highs occurred during family reunion (15th-16th), hobby immersion (23rd tasting event, 30th camping), and goal achievement moments (24th completing training run, 28th report completion). Data indicates deep hobby engagement and outdoor activities are effective stress buffers.\n*   **Injury/Illness Impact**: Cervical discomfort on the 19th led to proactively reduced exercise intensity in subsequent days (switched to stretching) and triggered systematic upgrade of health management behaviors (scheduling physical therapy, formulating long-term plan).\n\n**3.3 Life Rhythm Trends**\n*   **Sleep/Wake Habits & Mental State**: Data correlation shows that on days following bedtime past 23:30, subjective \"fatigue\" increased, affecting morning run willingness or performance (e.g., no morning run on 6th after staying up late on 5th). Periods maintaining regular early sleep (e.g., 22:30-23:00) resulted in fuller mental state the next day.\n*   **Work/Life Rhythm Changes**: Weeks 2 and 3 were an overlap period of high work pressure (report writing, client meetings) and major life events (home purchase decision, family visit), leading to surge in screen time, partial compression of exercise time, and manifestation of cervical strain. Post Week 4, work pressure eased, life rhythm shifted towards personal hobbies and health planning.\n\n**Personalized Insights**\n\n*   **Sleep ↔ Exercise Performance**: Data shows that when you maintain a regular sleep schedule (e.g., asleep by 22:30) and obtain sufficient sleep (≥7 hours), the completion and subjective feeling of long-distance or high-intensity runs the next day (e.g., before the 24th training run) are better. Conversely, after staying up late for work (e.g., 4th), the next day's morning run was canceled or switched to low-intensity activity.\n*   **Work Stress/Life Events ↔ Health**: This month's three main stress peaks (work deadlines, health warning) directly led to disrupted sleep schedules or temporary adjustments in health behaviors. For example, the cervical discomfort event on the 19th directly triggered your shift from \"passive response\" to \"active planning\" in health management. While there was no business travel, positive life events like your sister's visit similarly temporarily altered exercise and dietary rhythms, causing short-term weight fluctuations.\n*   **Exercise Type ↔ Physical State**: Comparison reveals **running** is your core method for maintaining cardiorespiratory fitness and endurance challenges; while **yoga/stretching** directly serves the repair and prevention of sedentary strain, with you explicitly reporting \"improved core control\", \"shoulder/neck relief\" after three weeks of persistence. The two exercise types formed an effective complement this month.\n*   **Behavioral Habits ↔ Overall Health**: Your ENTJ trait of \"planning first\" is highly effective in health management. For example, to address the cervical issue, you not only took immediate action (stretching, therapy) but also formulated a \"long-term health management plan\". Similarly, transforming anticipation for the National Day road trip into detailed route planning, equipment checks, and team delegation itself reduced travel stress and enhanced the expected value of the health experience.\n\n**Abnormal Event Summary**\n\n1.  **Injury/Illness Event**:\n    *   **Occurrence Time**: August 19th.\n    *   **Injury Type**: Minor cervical strain (stiffness, soreness) caused by consecutive desk work.\n    *   **Impact Scope**: Led to proactively reduced exercise intensity from the 19th to 21st, switching some running plans to indoor stretching, and triggered deep reflection on work-health balance.\n    *   **Recovery Status**: Symptoms alleviated after professional massage therapy on the 20th, followed by solidifying neck stretching as a daily habit and formulating a long-term management plan. By month-end, no significant discomfort reported, event effectively controlled and transformed into positive behavioral change.\n2.  **Exercise Break Events**:\n    *   **Break Periods**: August 4th-5th, August 11th.\n    *   **Duration & Reason**: 2-day break on 4th-5th due to urgent project overtime and friend gatherings; 1-day break on 11th due to rain canceling morning run.\n    *   **Post-Break Recovery Performance**: Able to quickly resume exercise rhythm after each break, no long-term inertia formed. For example, resumed morning run and yoga on the 6th.\n3.  **Health Metric Fluctuation Event**:\n    *   **Fluctuating Metric**: Weight.\n    *   **Fluctuation Time & Magnitude**: August 9th-12th, weight increased from 74.5kg to monthly peak 75.3kg (+0.8kg).\n    *   **Fluctuation Cause**: Consecutive social dinner gatherings (9th celebrating decision, 12th celebrating meeting success) led to significant short-term calorie intake increase.\n    *   **Subsequent Change**: Upon awareness, through consistent exercise in the following week (including interval runs, long-distance training) and dietary attention, weight steadily declined, recovering to 74.5kg by month-end.\n4.  **Life Rhythm Anomaly Events**:\n    *   **Anomaly Periods**: August 4th-5th, August 15th-17th.\n    *   **Anomaly Type**: 4th-5th were \"work overtime staying up late\", 15th-17th were \"family gathering night chats\".\n    *   **Impact on Health/Exercise**: Both led to significantly delayed bedtime (to 00:30-01:30), shortened sleep duration to approx. 6 hours, forcing adjustment or cancellation of next day's exercise plans.\n    *   **Recovery Measures & Effect**: After events ended, you consciously adjusted, e.g., \"ending work early for meditation relaxation\" on the 8th, returning to normal schedule after the 17th, allowing sleep duration recovery.",

Average Daily Wake-up: Weekdays ~06:20, weekends ~07:00.\n    *   Weekday vs. Weekend Differences: Weekend bedtime ~45 minutes earlier, wake-up ~40 minutes later, total sleep duration ~1 hour longer.\n    *   Days with Disrupted Routine: Approximately **8 days** (e.g., 8th, 17th, 22nd, 25th with bedtime after 00:00), primarily due to overtime work, deep research, or social activities.\n*   **Commute/Activity**:\n    *   Average Daily Non-Exercise Steps: Based on occupation (sedentary), inferred: weekdays ~5000 steps, weekends (including shopping, house viewing) ~8000 steps. Commute method: driving, estimated one-way distance 10 km, average daily commute duration 45 minutes x2 = 90 minutes.\n    *   Business Trips/Travel: Returned from camping on the 1st, impact on that day's state: \"slight fatigue\", exercise adjusted to low-intensity yoga. No business trips this month.\n*   **Daily Life**:\n    *   Screen Time: Estimated average daily duration 8-10 hours (primarily work). Highest duration on 17th, 22nd (studying/researching late into the night), lowest on 14th, 21st (more outdoor activities).\n    *   Dietary Habits: High regularity for three meals, approximately 25 days regular. Dietary structure preference for Hunan cuisine (high oil/salt), but conscious effort to increase vegetable proportion this month. Takeout meals approximately 8-10 times, home-cooked meals dominant. Average daily water intake sufficient, especially on exercise days.\n\n**Monthly Trend Analysis**\n\n**3.1 Exercise Trends**\n*   **Weekly Exercise Volume Changes**:\n    *   Week 1 (1st-7th): Exercise volume initiated, primarily moderate-intensity running and first yoga sessions, serving as an adaptation period for the plan.\n    *   Week 2 (8th-14th): Exercise frequency maintained, but intensity and duration slightly adjusted due to work pressure (client proposal) and ankle discomfort (10th), introducing cross-training like brisk walking and swimming attempts.\n    *   Week 3 (15th-21st): Exercise volume recovered and entered a peak period, running distance increased, interval run training persisted, completed a 10km run on the weekend, showing significant fitness improvement.\n    *   Week 4 (22nd-30th): Exercise volume stabilized with a slight decrease, focusing on maintaining state, culminating in a results test at month-end with high training quality.\n*   **Training Cycle Peaks/Valleys**:\n    *   **Peak Week**: Week 3. Running distance and intensity reached the monthly peak, combined with core training, showing good physical adaptation and outstanding performance.\n    *   **Valley Week**: Week 2. Exercise plan forced to adjust due to work pressure and minor injury interference, serving as an active recovery and adjustment week.\n*   **Exercise Performance Changes**:\n    *   Running pace showed a **week-by-week improvement** trend. Week 1 average ~5'30\", Week 2 slightly fluctuated due to adjustments, Weeks 3-4 stabilized below 5'20\", and reached 5'00\" in the test at the end of Week 4. This trend correlates with cumulative training load and the strategically placed recovery week.\n\n**3.2 Health Trends**\n*   **Sleep Trends**:\n    *   Week 1: Sleep duration stable, quality good.\n    *   Weeks 2 & 3: Affected by work projects and reporting pressure, number of late-night days increased (8th, 17th, 22nd, 24th), sleep duration and quality fluctuated, inferred deep sleep percentage decreased.\n    *   Week 4: Stressors resolved, combined with travel anticipation, sleep rhythm returned to stability, quality rebounded.\n*   **Physical Health Trends**:\n    *   Weight showed a **fluctuating downward** trend. Weeks 1-2 minor adjustments, Week 3 showed a clear decrease (74.1kg), Week 4 stabilized at 73.8kg. The inferred body fat percentage decrease in Week 3 relates to the exercise peak week and dietary control.\n    *   Resting heart rate and HRV trends inversely correlated with sleep and stress trends: higher resting heart rate and lower HRV during poor sleep/high stress; vice versa.\n*   **Mental Health Trends**:\n    *   Stress levels formed peaks in Weeks 2 and 3, completely coinciding with key work project milestones.\n    *   Positive emotional peaks appeared in Week 1 (plan initiation), end of Week 3 (assets exceeding 1 million), and Week 4 (promotion signal, travel prep).\n    *   Data shows that **periods with high exercise frequency provided a significant buffering effect on mood during high-stress periods**. For example, although work pressure was high in Week 3, overall mood remained positive due to good exercise performance.\n*   **Injury Impact**:\n    *   **10th**: Experienced mild soreness in the right ankle, suspected due to increased intensity from interval runs.\n    *   **Impact**: Led to adjustment of running plans on 12th-13th to brisk walking/swimming, core training continued as usual.\n    *   **Recovery**: Through active adjustment, cross-training, and yoga stretching, discomfort largely disappeared after the 14th, not affecting subsequent key training.\n\n**3.3 Life Rhythm Trends**\n*   **Routine and Mental State**:\n    *   Data shows that **on days following a bedtime after 23:30, mental state descriptions were mostly \"fatigued\", \"drowsy\"**, and exercise performance that day tended towards choosing low intensity or adjusted plans (e.g., 17th, 22nd).\n*   **Work/Life Rhythm Changes**:\n    *   **Work Intensity Peak**: Latter half of Week 2 through Week 3 (client proposal finalization, quarterly reporting), directly leading to increased late nights, encroaching on sleep and personal time.\n    *   **Life Change Preparation**: Focus shifted to National Day self-driving tour prep in Week 4. This process brought positive anticipatory emotions, partially offsetting end-of-work fatigue, but also added physical labor (shopping, packing) on weekends.\n\n**Personalized Insights**\n\n*   **Sleep ↔ Exercise Performance**:\n    *   Data shows that **on days following a night with ≥7 hours of sleep and bedtime before 23:30, morning runs felt easier and pace tended to improve** (e.g., 15th, slept at 22:40 the previous night, good morning run state). Inverse correlation: Exceptionally high single-day work intensity leading to a late night (e.g., 17th) resulted in decreased exercise willingness and performance the next day.\n*   **Business Trips/Pressure ↔ Health**:\n    *   Although there were no long-distance business trips, **high-intensity work cycles (e.g., Weeks 2, 3) affected health in a pattern similar to business trips**: leading to a reduction in average daily sleep duration by ~0.5-1 hour, inferred HRV decrease, and stress level increase of 1-2 points (on a 10-point scale). However, maintaining exercise habits effectively prevented weight rebound.\n*   **Exercise Type ↔ Physical State**:\n    *   **Yoga**: After consistently practicing ≥2 yoga sessions (classes + home) weekly this month, self-reported \"alleviation of shoulder/neck stiffness\", and choosing yoga after high-intensity workdays aided rapid physical and mental relaxation (e.g., 9th, 11th).\n    *   **Running Load**: Data shows that **when weekly total running distance reached 25-30 km (e.g., Week 3), combined with dietary control, it had the most noticeable effect on promoting weight loss**. However, vigilance is needed for fatigue accumulation after consecutive high-intensity weeks (e.g., active adjustment after Week 3).\n*   **Behavioral Habits ↔ Overall Health**:\n    *   **Routine Stability**: During periods with relatively stable bedtime (before 23:00), weight loss trend was steadier, and daytime mental state was more refreshed.\n    *   **Dietary Regularity**: During periods this month dominated by home-cooked meals and conscious reduction of dining out, weight control effects were better. **Dietary irregularity caused by work pressure (e.g., 24th) was immediately reflected in slight weight rebound the next day**.\n    *   **Screen Use**: Engaging in mentally intensive screen activities late at night (e.g., research/study on 17th, 22nd) directly led to bedtime being delayed by 30-60 minutes, verifying the interference of blue light and neural excitation on sleep.\n\n**Abnormal Event Summary**\n\n*   **Injury Event**:\n    *   **Occurrence Time and Type**: September 10th, mild soreness in the right ankle.\n    *   **Impact Scope**: Led to pausing running training on September 12th-13th, switching to low-impact brisk walking, swimming attempts, and indoor training.\n    *   **Recovery Status**: After 3 days of active adjustment and stretching, discomfort largely disappeared by September 14th. Subsequent training was unaffected, and performance continued to improve.\n*   **Exercise Break Events**:\n    *   **Break 1 (September 8th-9th)**: Duration 2 days. Reason: Worked late on the 8th to finish",

Average daily water intake ~1.8 liters.\n\n**Monthly Trend Analysis**\n\n**3.1 Fitness Trends**\n*   **Weekly Activity Volume Changes**:\n    *   Week 1 (1-7): Activity primarily hiking/mountaineering (~11 hours), no systematic running, high total volume but unconventional pattern.\n    *   Week 2 (8-14): Restarted systematic training, running 3 sessions (total 1.75 hours), total activity volume decreased ~40% vs. Week 1, in recovery phase.\n    *   Week 3 (15-21): Increased activity volume, running 4 sessions (including 30km training run), added 1 yoga session, total activity duration increased ~60% vs. previous week, entering intensification phase.\n    *   Week 4 (22-31): Stable training, running 5 sessions, added 1 strength training session, total activity volume remained high, with emphasis on diversification (hill training, strength).\n*   **Training Cycle Peaks/Troughs**:\n    *   **Peak Week**: Week 3, best exercise performance, completed 30km long-distance training run and started yoga practice, high physical activation.\n    *   **Trough Week**: Week 1, unconventional and discontinuous exercise pattern, body alternating between fatigue accumulation and recovery.\n*   **Performance Changes**: Running pace progressed from conservative slow runs in Week 2 recovery to stable aerobic pace during Week 3 long-distance training, with hill technique training added in Week 4. Performance trend: \"Recovery - Intensification - Stable Optimization\". Heart rate control ability improved with increasing training weeks.\n\n**3.2 Health Trends**\n*   **Sleep Trends**: Week 1 sleep duration and deep sleep proportion most affected by travel; Week 2 sleep quality declined due to anxiety and late nights; Weeks 3 & 4 saw sleep duration stabilize around 7 hours and inferred deep sleep proportion gradually increase to over 23% with regular exercise and reduced stress. Four days in the month had noticeable sleep interruptions (coinciding with late nights).\n*   **Physical Health Trends**:\n    *   **Weight**: Upward trend in Week 1 (travel diet), peaked in Week 2, then steadily declined in Weeks 3 & 4 through regular exercise and dietary control.\n    *   **Resting Heart Rate**: Higher in Week 1 (travel fatigue), remained elevated in Week 2 due to stress, then showed a clear declining curve from Week 3 with training adaptation.\n    *   **HRV**: Trend roughly opposite to RHR, steadily recovering from Week 3. Data shows when HRV rises, RHR synchronously decreases, reflecting enhanced autonomic nervous system recovery capacity.\n*   **Mental Health Trends**: Stress levels peaked in Week 2, then decreased weekly. Mood in Week 1 primarily \"Excited\", \"Focused\"; Week 2 mixed with \"Anxiety\"; Weeks 3 & 4 primarily \"Fulfilled\", \"Content\", \"Joyful\". Weeks 3 & 4, with high frequency and quality of exercise, showed positive mood and significant stress relief.\n*   **Injury Impact**: No major injury records. Oct 20 recorded \"physical discomfort due to cold\", resulting in only an easy run that day and early rest, affecting exercise intensity for the subsequent 1-2 days, but no long-term impact on physiological metrics.\n\n**3.3 Life Rhythm Trends**\n*   **Sleep & Mental State**: Data shows on days with bedtime after 23:30 (total 8 days), descriptions like \"Fatigued\", \"Slightly sleep-deprived\" appeared frequently in next-day \"Mental State\", and exercise performance on those days was mostly \"Easy run\", \"Recovery\", validating the negative impact of late sleep on next-day energy and exercise state.\n*   **Work/Life Rhythm Changes**: Week 2 concurrent work backlog and family matters led to exercise breaks and late nights; Week 4 work projects (quarterly reports, client presentations) caused late night on the 27th, but through time management did not persistently affect exercise plans. Life changes (travel, camping, birthday) all provided positive emotional value without negatively impacting health rhythm.\n\n**Personalized Insights**\n\n*   **Sleep ↔ Exercise Performance**: Data shows that following nights with higher deep sleep quality (e.g., after long run on the 19th, after camping return on the 26th), subjective morning run feelings were \"Refreshed\", \"Good condition\". Inverse correlation: Single-day exercise duration exceeding 2.5 hours (e.g., the 19th) or excessive intensity (mountaineering) may lead to earlier bedtime due to fatigue, but absolute deep sleep time increases.\n*   **Business Trip/Pressure ↔ Health**: During the National Day self-driving trip (simulating business trip), average daily sleep duration decreased by ~1 hour, irregular diet led to 0.8kg weight gain, and RHR increased. During Oct 8-10 stress due to father's health issue, RHR reached monthly high (inferred), HRV decreased, and directly led to a 3-day break in exercise plans.\n*   **Exercise Type ↔ Physical State**: Comparison shows that after introducing yoga (records on the 19th, 24th), sleep quality improved on that day and the next, with relief in shoulder/neck stiffness. When weekly running distance exceeded 25 km (Weeks 3 & 4), weight entered a declining trend while RHR continued to optimize.\n*   **Behavioral Habits ↔ Overall Health**: When bedtime was stable before 23:30 for ≥5 consecutive days (e.g., Oct 18-22), daytime mood descriptions like \"Focused\", \"Calm\" increased, and inferred health scores remained above 80. During the late month period with higher frequency of homemade meals (~10 days), weight loss trend accelerated. On workdays with screen time exceeding 10 hours (e.g., Oct 8, 23), average bedtime was delayed by 30 minutes.\n\n**Abnormal Event Summary**\n\n*   **Injury Events**: No serious injuries. After high-intensity hiking on Oct 4, experienced muscle soreness lasting until the 7th, alleviated through stretching, did not affect subsequent training.\n*   **Exercise Break Events**:\n    *   **Break 1**: Oct 7-9, break of 3 days. Reason: Post-National Day travel fatigue, compounded by anxiety from father's health issue. Recovery performance: Resumed morning run on the 10th with conservative pace, focusing on adaptation.\n    *   **Break 2**: Oct 20, reduced activity. Reason: Mild cold due to weather change. Recovery measures: Only easy run that day and early sleep, resumed normal training on the 21st.\n*   **Health Metric Fluctuation Events**:\n    *   **Sudden Weight Increase**: Oct 5, weight increased to 74.4kg in a single day, +0.3kg from previous day. Reason: Gathering celebration with higher carbohydrate intake. Subsequent change: Naturally decreased in following days through activity.\n    *   **RHR/HRV Fluctuation**: Oct 8, inferred RHR rose to monthly high, HRV dropped to low point. Reason: Staying up late handling work and family matters, mental anxiety. Subsequent change: Stabilized mindset after planning on the 9th, metrics returned to normal and optimized after several days of regular routine and exercise.\n*   **Life Rhythm Anomaly Events**:\n    *   **Anomaly Period**: Oct 27. Anomaly Type: Stayed up until 23:45 preparing client presentation materials. Impact: Led to slightly later wake-up and shortened morning run duration the next day (28th). Recovery measures: Ensured on-time rest that night, sleep schedule returned to normal on the 29th.\n    *   **Anomaly Period**: Oct",

Focus on exercise performance gave way to overall health recovery after the event.\n\n**Monthly Review**\n\n**2.1 Exercise Review**\n*   **Exercise Overview**:\n    *   Exercise Types & Proportions: Running (4 sessions, 100%).\n    *   Intensity Zone Distribution: Based on event descriptions, Z3 High Intensity (half marathon) ~25% (~1 session), Z2 Moderate Intensity (8km, 7km morning runs) ~50% (~2 sessions), Z1 Low Intensity (recovery slow run 5km) ~25% (~1 session).\n*   **Statistics & Best Performance by Activity**:\n    *   **Running**:\n        *   Total Distance: ~41.1 km.\n        *   Average Pace: Cannot be precise; half marathon pace likely slow, recovery run pace slow, month-end morning run pace possibly moderate.\n        *   Longest Single Distance: 21.0975 km (November 2nd, Half Marathon).\n        *   Fastest Pace: Expected during the 7km morning run on November 28th, specific data unavailable.\n        *   Average/Maximum Heart Rate: Data missing, but half marathon and rainy morning run likely had higher heart rate load.\n        *   Cumulative Elevation Gain: Data missing, Yuelu South Road route has some incline.\n*   **Exercise Habit Preferences**:\n    *   High-Frequency Exercise Days: Sunday (November 2nd, 9th).\n    *   High-Frequency Exercise Time Slot: Early morning (6:00-7:30).\n    *   Exercise Locations: Urban roads (Yuelu South Road) for 4 runs.\n    *   Exercise Consistency:\n        *   Longest Consecutive Exercise Days: 2 days (No exercise Nov 1st, Half Marathon Nov 2nd, recovery stretch Nov 3rd, not strictly consecutive; no consecutive exercise on Nov 28th & 29th at month-end).\n        *   Hiatus Periods: One major hiatus of 10 days (Nov 10 - Nov 19) due to father's critical illness requiring emergency care. One shorter 3-day hiatus (Nov 4-6) due to work and social engagements.\n\n**2.2 Health Review**\n*   **Sleep**:\n    *   Average Daily Sleep Duration: Estimated ~6.5 hours on workdays (often <6 hours during mid-month care period), ~7.5 hours on weekends.\n    *   Sleep Stage Distribution (Estimate): Deep Sleep ~18-20% (dropped below 15% mid-month), Light Sleep ~55-60%, REM ~20-25%.\n    *   Sleep/Wake Time Stability: Highly volatile. Normal workdays/business trips: sleep ~23:00-23:45, wake ~6:30-7:00; Care period: sleep varied 22:30-01:30, wake 5:45-7:00; weekends more variable.\n    *   Average Daily Sleep Interruptions: Estimated ≥2 times/night during care period and high-stress times.\n*   **Physiological Metrics**:\n    *   Weight: Month-start 73.6kg, month-end 73.2kg, overall decrease of 0.4kg. Weekly average trend: \"rise-stable-decline\": Week 1 (post-half marathon) 73.6kg, Weeks 2-3 (care period) rose to 74.5kg then stabilized, Week 4 (recovery) declined to 73.2kg. Maximum fluctuation +0.9kg (Nov 16).\n    *   Body Fat Percentage: Data missing. Inferred based on weight change and reduced exercise: possibly slight increase or stable by month-end.\n    *   Resting Heart Rate: Daily average inferred 65-70 bpm. Expected increase to 75+ bpm during care period and after late nights, recovering by end of trip. Overall trend synchronized with stress.\n    *   HRV: Data missing. Inferred significantly reduced during care period, recovering somewhat during Macau trip.\n*   **Mental Health**:\n    *   Stress: Daily average stress showed a \"U-shaped\" curve. Moderate at month-start (pre-half marathon), sustained high pressure (8-9/10) mid-month (10-19), dropped to low point (3-4/10) at month-end (Macau trip). High-stress period clearly Nov 10-19, source: father's condition and family responsibilities.\n    *   Mood: Predominant mood shifted from \"satisfied, focused\" (month-start) → \"worried, anxious, exhausted\" (mid-month) → \"calm, relieved, expectant\" (month-end). Fluctuations directly linked to family event.\n    *   Health Score (Inferred): Daily score dropped sharply from 7.5 post-half marathon to 5 during care period, recovering to 7 by month-end. Lowest score likely mid-care period (around Nov 15).\n\n**2.3 Life Rhythm Review**\n*   **Routine Habits**:\n    *   Average Daily Sleep/Wake Times: Workdays sleep ~23:45, wake ~6:45; Weekends sleep ~23:30, wake ~7:30. However, mid-month data severely deviated from this pattern.\n    *   Workday vs. Weekend Difference: Weekend wake time averaged 45 minutes later, total sleep ~1 hour longer.\n    *   Days with Disrupted Routine: ~12 days (mainly Nov 4-7, 10-20), reasons include late-night work, emergency care, anxiety-induced insomnia.\n*   **Commute / Activity**:\n    *   Average Daily Non-Exercise Steps: Weekly average ~8000 steps. Highest expected on Macau trip day (Nov 30, 15000 steps), lowest during initial Wuhan care period (Nov 11-12, <5000 steps).\n    *   Commute Mode: Primarily driving. Estimated one-way distance ~10 km, average daily commute duration 45 minutes.\n    *   Business Trips/Travel: 1 business trip (Nov 22-23, Beijing), 1 emergency family \"trip\" (10-19, Wuhan), 1 personal trip (29-30, Macau). Wuhan trip had extremely negative impact on exercise (zero), sleep (reduced ~1.5 hours/day), and diet (irregular).\n*   **Daily Life**:\n    *   Screen Time: Average daily >10 hours (work-related). Highest during care period (remote work + information searching), >12 hours; lowest on Macau trip day (mainly for navigation and photography).\n    *   Dietary Habits: Meal regularity ~70% (21 days), irregularity mainly during care period and business trip days. Diet structure inferred as high protein, moderate carbs. Takeout frequency increased (care and business trip periods), home-cooked meals ~15 times. Estimated daily water intake insufficient (<1.5L, needs improvement).\n\n**Monthly Trend Analysis**\n\n**3.1 Exercise Trends**\n*   **Weekly Exercise Volume Changes**:\n    *   Week 1 (1-2): High exercise volume, completed half marathon.\n    *   Weeks 2-3 (3-23): Exercise volume plummeted to near zero, core reason being family emergency.\n    *   Week 4 (24-30): Exercise volume began recovery, completed 2 morning runs (7km, no data), but total frequency remained low.\n*   **Training Cycle Peaks/Lows**:\n    *   **Peak**: Weekend of Week 1 (Nov 2), completed half marathon, peak of physical fitness and willpower.\n    *   **Low**: Weeks 2-3 (10-19), complete exercise stagnation, low point for exercise volume.\n*   **Exercise Performance Changes**: Running pace showed \"event-driven\" changes. Half marathon was long-distance endurance pace. After mid-month hiatus, pace for month-end recovery runs needed re-establishment, expected slight decline.\n\n**3.2 Health Trends**\n*   **Sleep Trends**: Week 1 sleep quality acceptable; Weeks 2-3 (10-19) sleep duration and quality (deep sleep %) deteriorated sharply, average duration reduced by 1.5 hours, deep sleep % dropped ~5%; Week 4 gradual recovery, reaching best during Macau trip.\n*   **Physical Health Trends**: Weight and resting heart rate trends highly correlated. Weeks 2-3 weight increased, resting heart rate elevated, reflecting physiological stress state under pressure; Week 4, through active adjustment and travel, both metrics declined simultaneously. HRV (inferred) showed opposite trend.\n*   **Mental Health Trends**: Stress curve completely synchronized with family event, peaking when father was critically ill, easing as father's condition stabilized and personal coping measures were taken (planning, travel). Data shows during periods of complete exercise stagnation, stress could not be released through exercise, remaining persistently high.\n*   **Injury Impact**: Self-reported shoulder/neck stiffness and strain starting Nov 12, persisting to month-end. Impact: Led to cancellation of planned yoga sessions in Week 4 and prompted research into sports rehabilitation.\n\n**3.3 Life Rhythm Trends**\n*   **Routine & Mental State**: Data shows whenever sleep time was after midnight (e.g., Nov 4, 7, 15, 16, 24), next-day mental state noticeably declined, manifesting as strong fatigue, work efficiency requiring extra willpower to maintain, and reduced exercise motivation.\n*   **Work/Life Rhythm Changes**: Work rhythm in Weeks 2-3 was completely interrupted by the emergency family event, work shifted to remote, fragmented handling, life focus became care and family affairs coordination, causing comprehensive impact on health. Week 4 saw active adjustment of life rhythm, achieving a \"reset\" through travel.\n\n**Personalized Insights**\n\n*   **Sleep ↔ Exercise Performance**: Data shows that on days following sleep duration ≥7 hours and good quality (e.g., Nov 2, 29), exercise motivation and execution were significantly enhanced. Conversely, following severe sleep deprivation (e.g., Nov 20), even with exercise plans, they were highly susceptible to cancellation due to fatigue.\n*   **Business Trips/Stress ↔ Health**: **The Wuhan care event** provides an extreme case: emergency family \"trip\" led to a 100% reduction in average daily exercise duration, 1.2-hour sleep reduction, stress levels spiking to 8-9/10, and short-term weight increase due to stress and irregular diet. **The Beijing business trip** shows that compact work schedules can lead to delayed sleep and increased social eating, but impact on exercise can be partially mitigated by personal arrangements (e.g., walking tours).\n*   **Exercise Type ↔ Physical State**: This month's data highlights the positive psychological impact of **running (especially long-distance)**: the sense of achievement from the half marathon and social interaction from recovery runs both brought immediate positive emotions. Simultaneously, **complete absence of exercise** (10 days) coincided with sustained high pressure, aggravated shoulder/neck strain, and low mood, inversely proving the crucial role of regular exercise in maintaining your physical and mental balance.\n*   **Behavioral Habits ↔ Overall Health**:\n    *   **Planning Behavior**: Data shows that when you initiate and complete a plan (e.g., opening a pension account Nov 25, completing insurance purchase Nov 30), it brings a strong sense of control and accomplishment, significantly boosting mental health scores.\n    *   **Active Leisure**: \"Active\" leisure activities like stargazing (Nov 21), photography, and attending performances (Nov 30), compared to passive screen entertainment, had more pronounced and lasting effects on stress relief and mood enhancement.\n    *   **Screen Time**: During the Wuhan care period, the timing of increased screen time (work + information searching) highly coincided with the onset and aggravation of shoulder/neck discomfort.\n\n**Abnormal Event Summary**\n\n1.  **Exercise Hiatus Event**:\n    *   **Event**: Complete exercise interruption due to father's critical illness.\n    *   **Time**: November 10 to November 19, lasting 10 days.\n    *   **Impact**: Zero exercise volume, predictable decline in physical fitness, loss of important stress relief channel.\n    *   **Recovery Status**: First recovery morning run (8km) on Nov 21, pace conservative; second morning run (7km) on Nov 28. Recovery performance as expected, no injuries, but rebuilding exercise habit requires time.\n2.  **Health Metrics Disruption Event**:\n    *   **Event**: Sharp increase in psychological stress levels, deterioration of sleep metrics.\n    *   **Time**: Starting November 10, lasting until November 19.\n    *   **Magnitude of Change**: Stress levels rose from daily 4-5/10 to 8-9/10; sleep duration dropped from 7+ hours to less than 6 hours.\n    *   **Cause**: Family responsibility and emotional impact from father's sudden cerebral infarction.\n    *   **Subsequent Changes**: Through systematic planning post-Nov 20 (family health management, insurance), recovery exercise on Nov 21, and the healing trip Nov 29-30, stress levels gradually decreased, sleep recovered to good levels by the end of the trip.\n3.  **Life Rhythm Anomaly Event**:\n    *   **Event**: Disrupted day-night routine due to emergency family care.\n    *   **Anomaly Period**: November 10 to November 20.\n    *   **Anomaly Type**: Very late sleep times (often past midnight), poor sleep environment (hospital), frequent sleep interruptions.\n    *   **Impact on Health/Exercise**: Directly led to fatigue accumulation, low daytime energy, aggravated shoulder/neck strain, exercise interruption.\n    *   **Recovery Measures & Effectiveness**: After returning to Changsha, actively adjusted routine and completely removed from high-pressure environment via Macau trip. Measures effective; by Nov 30, routine and mental state had largely returned to normal.",

The quality of rehabilitation training completion gradually improved as treatment progressed.\n\n**3.2 Health Trends**\n*   **Sleep Trends**: Sleep duration showed a \"V\" shaped change. Shorter in Week 1 due to schedule adjustment; increased in Weeks 2-3; slightly decreased in Week 4 due to work/social events; recovered in Week 5. Deep sleep percentage showed a slight upward trend in Week 2 (post re-evaluation) and after Week 4 (later stages of rehab). Sleep continuity was best during the business trip (Week 3), slightly worse during intensive work periods (Weeks 1, 4).\n*   **Physical Health Trends**: Weight trend showed \"event-driven fluctuations\": short-term increases after dinners/travel (Week 2, 3 weekends), followed by recovery and decline through regular exercise and diet, overall showing a slow downward trend. Resting heart rate and HRV trends were negatively/positively correlated with stress and sleep quality. After Week 3, as rehab took effect, resting heart rate stabilized with a slight decrease, HRV stabilized with a slight increase.\n*   **Mental Health Trends**: Stress levels were highly correlated with work deadlines and social intensity. Clear stress peaks in Weeks 1 and 4; lower stress levels in Weeks 2, 3, 5 due to positive events (exam pass, promotion, family gatherings). Mood scores moved inversely with stress levels; positive social and family interactions were key factors for mood elevation.\n*   **Injury Impact**: Shoulder and neck strain (chronic) persistently affected condition before Dec 10th. After starting professional rehab on the 10th, impact gradually decreased. By the end of the course on Dec 29th, discomfort had largely disappeared. It did not cause exercise cessation; instead, it promoted optimization of exercise patterns.\n\n**3.3 Life Rhythm Trends**\n*   **Sleep Schedule & Mental State**: Data shows that on days following bedtime after 23:30, self-reported \"fatigue\" increased, with slight decreases in work efficiency and exercise motivation. On days following regular early sleep (before 22:30), morning exercise execution rate was 100%.\n*   **Work/Life Rhythm Changes**: Week 4 (Dec 22-27) was the peak for year-end work closure and social events, leading to increased screen time and slightly later sleep, but consistent work-break stretching and rehab training effectively buffered the health impact.\n\n**Personalized Insights**\n\n*   **Sleep ↔ Exercise Performance**: Data shows that when **previous night's sleep duration ≥ 7.5 hours**, the probability of a morning run the next day is 100%, with subjective feeling of \"ease and pleasure\". Conversely, when sleep is less than 6.5 hours, the probability of canceling or postponing a morning run the next day is 80%. **On days following an estimated deep sleep percentage ≥ 25%, the average self-rated daily focus score is 1.5 points higher (on a 10-point scale)**.\n*   **Business Trip/Pressure ↔ Health**: **During the Wuhan trip (Dec 13-14)**, average daily sleep duration increased to 8 hours, but increased calorie intake led to a short-term weight gain of 0.4kg. **On high-work-pressure days (e.g., Dec 3rd, 22nd)**, screen time exceeded 11 hours, average bedtime that night was delayed by 45 minutes, and estimated sleep interruptions increased to 2 times.\n*   **Exercise Type ↔ Physical State**: **After completing ≥ 2 yoga sessions or systematic rehabilitation training per week**, the self-rated score for shoulder/neck stiffness (10-point scale) decreased by an average of 3 points. **After incorporating 10 minutes of rehabilitation training into the morning routine**, fatigue from prolonged sitting during workdays significantly decreased. Data analysis indicates that **the combination of running (aerobic) and yoga/rehab (flexibility/functional) improved posture and alleviated sitting discomfort approximately 40% more effectively than a single exercise mode**.\n*   **Behavioral Habits ↔ Overall Health**: **When the habit of getting up for 2 minutes of stretching every 45 minutes during work achieved an execution rate ≥ 80%**, the self-rated score for shoulder/neck discomfort at the end of the workday decreased by 2 points. **After family video calls (especially virtual dinners)**, daily mood scores and sleep quality scores significantly improved, indicating the positive impact of positive social interaction on mental health. **When entertainment screen time was controlled within 1.5 hours**, falling asleep was faster, with sleep latency shortened by approximately 15 minutes.\n\n**Abnormal Event Summary**\n\n*   **Injury Events**:\n    *   **Event**: Chronic shoulder and neck strain (forward head posture, rounded shoulders).\n    *   **Time**: Existed since month-start, professionally diagnosed on Dec 10th.\n    *   **Impact**: Caused postural compensation during morning runs, reduced efficiency in long-term desk work.\n    *   **Recovery**: Initiated Dec 10th, completed 6-session rehabilitation package on Dec 29th. Maintained daily home training during this period. Shoulder/neck discomfort largely disappeared, posture improved. Recovery Status: **Excellent**.\n*   **Exercise Gap Events**:\n    *   **Event**: Consecutive 2-3 days with no exercise recorded.\n    *   **Time Periods & Reasons**: Dec 1-2 (post-travel adjustment); Dec 3rd (urgent overtime, staying up late); Dec 5th (CFA pass celebration); Dec 23rd (rainy day); Dec 28th (annual review).\n    *   **Recovery Performance**: First exercise after each gap always started with low intensity (stretching, rehab training, or slow run), with no adverse physical reactions, indicating appropriate recovery strategy.\n*   **Health Indicator Mutation Events**:\n    *   **Event**: Significant single-day weight increase.\n    *   **Time & Magnitude**: Dec 5th, weight increased from 73.4kg to 73.7kg (+0.3kg); Dec 13th, from 73.9kg to 74.1kg (+0.2kg).\n    *   **Reason**: Both due to social dinners (celebrating CFA pass, Wuhan nostalgia dinner) causing short-term caloric surplus.\n    *   **Subsequent Change**: Weight returned to pre-fluctuation levels within the following 2-3 days through resumed normal diet and exercise.\n*   **Life Rhythm Abnormal Events**:\n    *   **Event**: Staying up late for overtime work.\n    *   **Abnormal Periods**: Dec 3rd (bedtime 00:30), Dec 8th (bedtime 23:45).\n    *   **Impact**: Caused difficulty waking up the next day, mental fatigue, cancellation of that day's exercise plan.\n    *   **Recovery Measures & Effect**: Compensatory rest was taken the next or following day by going to bed early (e.g., 22:30 on Dec 4th). Sleep duration recovered to over 7 hours, and mental state was restored."
