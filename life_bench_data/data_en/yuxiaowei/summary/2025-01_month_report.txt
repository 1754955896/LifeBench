Diet structure leans towards traditional Hong Kong style (high carb, moderate protein), with high-calorie gatherings on weekends and holidays (e.g., Jan 4th, 12th, 28th). Few takeout meals (estimated <5), primarily home-cooked meals. Daily water intake data not provided, but inferred from health awareness, basic intake is likely maintained.

**Monthly Trend Analysis**

**3.1 Exercise Trends**
*   **Weekly Exercise Volume Changes**:
    *   **Week 1 (Jan 1-5)**: Low total exercise volume (only one 5km run), in holiday recovery and planning phase.
    *   **Week 2 (Jan 6-12)**: Exercise volume increased significantly, 3 runs (total 19km), 1 yoga session. ~300% increase compared to previous week. Reason: Resumed morning run habit, initiated systematic training, and completed marathon registration.
    *   **Week 3 (Jan 13-19)**: Exercise volume peaked, 4 runs (total 41km, including 15km long run), 2 yoga sessions. Running distance increased 116% compared to previous week. Reason: Officially entered marathon preparation cycle, with increased training intensity and volume.
    *   **Week 4 (Jan 20-26) & Chinese New Year Week (Jan 27-31)**: Exercise volume first suppressed then rebounded. Early Week 4 had a gap due to cold and work, but training resumed in the latter half and Chinese New Year week, totaling 4 runs (39km), 1 yoga session, 2 interval run sessions. Overall exercise rhythm was affected by the holiday but remained consistent.
*   **Training Cycle Peaks/Valleys**:
    *   **Peak Week**: Week 3 (Jan 13-19), characterized by highest running volume (41km), completion of first long-distance run (15km), exercise performance and confidence at a high point.
    *   **Valley Period**: Early Week 4 (Jan 20-22), 3 consecutive days without exercise due to physical discomfort (cold) and work pressure, representing a clear monthly low point.
*   **Exercise Performance Changes**:
    *   **Running Pace/Heart Rate Trend**: Progressed from easy runs (primarily Z2) in Weeks 1-2, to incorporating tempo runs and long-distance (Z2-Z3 mix) in Week 3, to adding interval runs (Z3 peaks) in Week 4 and month-end. Pace stability in aerobic base improved, with high-pace capability receiving targeted stimulation. Data suggests that as training progressed, perceived exertion for completing the same distance (e.g., 10km) decreased.

**3.2 Health Trends**
*   **Sleep Trends**:
    *   **Duration and Quality**: Sleep was relatively regular and sufficient in Weeks 1-2. Week 3 saw compressed sleep duration and potentially reduced quality due to work pressure (20th) and urgent overtime (22nd). Week 4 Chinese New Year holiday provided ample sleep duration but disrupted regularity (late to bed, late to rise). Deep sleep percentage fluctuations showed negative correlation with stressful events and exercise recovery needs.
    *   **Sleep Continuity**: Sleep throughout the month was affected by work, social activities, and family (child), with few nights completely uninterrupted, but no reports of severe insomnia.
*   **Physical Health Trends**:
    *   **Weight Curve**: Showed "step-like" fluctuations. Weight stable with slight decrease during training weeks (Weeks 2, 3) (54.8-55.2kg). Immediately rose 0.3-0.6kg following social/family feasts (Week 2, 4 weekends), then quickly adjusted back during subsequent training days. Indicates active metabolism but sensitivity to diet.
    *   **Resting Heart Rate and HRV Correlation**: Inferred that on days like Jan 15th (after yoga), Jan 19th (after long run with sufficient rest), HRV was higher and resting heart rate lower. On days like Jan 22nd (after overtime/late night), Jan 24th (after emotional stress), HRV was lower and resting heart rate elevated.
*   **Mental Health Trends**:
    *   **Stress and Mood Curve**: Stress levels highly synchronized with work intensity. Week 3 was a clear high-stress period, accompanied by brief mood fluctuations. Exercise (especially social runs with friends, yoga) and deep socializing (heart-to-heart talks with close friend) were effective stress release valves, with significant improvement in mood and stress scores following each deep social interaction or high-quality training session.
*   **Injury Impact**:
    *   Right calf muscle soreness appeared on Jan 14th. Direct impact: Prompted more focused stretching/relaxation in the Jan 15th yoga session and reminded to pay more attention to warm-up and recovery in subsequent training. Did not cause training interruption but signaled the body entering an intensity adaptation phase.

**3.3 Life Rhythm Trends**
*   **Sleep Schedule and Mental State**: Data shows that when bedtime was before 23:00 (e.g., Jan 7th, 21st), the next day's morning run state was better and daytime work efficiency higher. When bedtime was after 23:30 (e.g., Jan 2nd, 8th, 22nd), even with exercise the next day, feelings of "fatigue" and "mental fatigue" were more common.
*   **Work/Life Rhythm Changes**:
    *   **Work Intensity Changes**: Week 3 (especially 20th-22nd) had the highest work intensity, involving client complaint handling and urgent case overtime, directly compressing exercise and sleep time.
    *   **Life Changes**: Week 4 entered Chinese New Year holiday, life focus completely shifted to family gatherings and leisure, exercise transitioned from "training mode" to "maintenance mode", sleep duration increased but regularity decreased.

**Personalized Insights**

*   **Sleep ↔ Exercise Performance**: Data shows that on days **following sufficient sleep (>7 hours) and stable bedtime (before 23:00)**, Yu Xiaowei's morning run pace was more stable, and perceived exertion for completing tempo or long-distance runs was lower. For example, good rest the night before the Jan 19th long run led to successful
