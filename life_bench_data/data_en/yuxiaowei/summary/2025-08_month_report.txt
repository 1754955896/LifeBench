*   **Weekly Exercise Volume Changes:**
    *   **Week 1 (Aug 1-3):** 2 exercise sessions, both swimming, in plan initiation/adaptation phase.
    *   **Week 2 (Aug 4-10):** 5 exercise sessions, added strength training, and attempted park walks on weekend. **Exercise volume increased 150% month-over-month**, due to increased confidence post-rehabilitation assessment.
    *   **Week 3 (Aug 11-17):** 4 exercise sessions, including rest after mild muscle soreness. **Exercise volume decreased 20% month-over-month**, demonstrating reasonable listening to the body.
    *   **Week 4 (Aug 18-24):** 5 exercise sessions, resumed running and added yoga. **Exercise volume increased 25% month-over-month**, entering rehabilitation consolidation phase.
    *   **Week 5 (Aug 25-31):** 5 exercise sessions, concluding with "strength + swimming" combined training. **Exercise volume remained stable**.
*   **Training Cycle Peaks/Valleys:**
    *   **Peak Week:** Week 4, with the most diverse exercise types and resumption of running, both mentally and physically optimal.
    *   **Valley Week:** Week 3, with a slight decrease in exercise frequency and intensity due to proactive adjustment for muscle soreness, representing a scientifically adaptive low point.
*   **Exercise Performance Changes:** Swimming progressed from initial 30-minute breaststroke to later 30-minute freestyle, with improvements in endurance and technique. Strength training progressed from needing coach guidance to independently completing combined sets, showing enhanced stability. Monthly exercise performance showed a steady upward curve of "adaptation - improvement - adjustment - consolidation."

#### **3.2 Health Trends**
*   **Sleep Trends:** Weeks 2 & 3 saw several late nights and reduced sleep duration due to work project pressure and creative project initiation. Weeks 4 & 5 saw sleep duration and regularity return to good levels as projects concluded and mindset adjusted.
*   **Physical Health Trends:** Weight showed a **fluctuating downward trend**. Slight increase at end of Week 1 due to family gathering, decreased to 54.1kg in Weeks 2 & 3 through regular exercise and dietary control, minor rebound in Week 4 due to celebration dinner, and recovery of downward trend in Week 5 through adjustment. Body fat percentage trend largely synchronized with weight. Resting heart rate remained overall stable.
*   **Mental Health Trends:** Stress levels showed two minor peaks in Week 2 (project initiation) and early Week 5 (financial review). Mood peaks occurred at end of Week 4 (promotion recognition) and end of Week 5 (task completion). **Data shows that periods with higher exercise frequency had significantly more positive mood tags.**
*   **Injury Impact:** Core goal this month was avoiding recurrence of old injury (plantar fasciitis). "Slight plantar stinging" occurred after training on August 6, effectively controlled through immediate rest (slept at 22:30 that day), with no impact on subsequent training, demonstrating excellent self-management.

#### **3.3 Life Rhythm Trends**
*   **Sleep/Wake Habits & Mental State:** When bedtime was later than 23:30, next-day mental state descriptions often included words like "slightly tired," "fatigued," e.g., August 2, 5. Conversely, days following a regular sleep schedule (before 22:30) were often accompanied by descriptions like "energetic," "calm and steady," e.g., August 6, 27.
*   **Work/Life Rhythm Changes:** Work intensity increased in Weeks 2 & 3 (new project, podcast recording), leading to later bedtimes and increased screen time. After Week 4, work rhythm stabilized due to recognition of achievements, and life focus transitioned towards family matters (school preparation). Exercise rhythm was not disrupted, indicating improved time management skills.

### **Module 4: Personalized Insights**

*   **Sleep ↔ Exercise Performance:** Data shows that when you ensured adequate prior-night sleep (especially before 22:30), next-day exercise descriptions more frequently included positive feedback like "felt good," "focused," "enjoyed," e.g., August 16, 27. Conversely, after staying up late (e.g., August 5), the next day either had no exercise scheduled or state was described as "slightly tired."
*   **Stress/Finance ↔ Health:** Two clear stressful events this month (work project, financial review) both triggered immediate emotional fluctuations or mild headaches (August 10, 25). However, you successfully brought mood and health perception back to baseline within 1-2 days through strong social support methods like "sharing with family" (August 18), "deep conversation with close friend" (August 24), and active regulation like "performing relaxing yoga" (August 25). **This demonstrates excellent emotional recovery ability and the utility of your social support system.**
*   **Exercise Type ↔ Physical State:** **Swimming was your "anchor" this month.** After plantar discomfort (August 6) and muscle soreness (August 21), you chose swimming as a safe and effective maintenance training. **Strength training positively correlated with weight management effectiveness.** During periods of regular strength training (Weeks 2, 4, 5), weight showed a more stable downward trend. Recovery running (Week 4) significantly boosted psychological pleasure.
*   **Behavioral Habits ↔ Overall Health:** **The eco-friendly habit of "carrying a thermos" is not only an external manifestation of a healthy lifestyle but also an active behavior that reinforces your personal identity and expands social conversation topics** (August 3, 12, 24). **Cantonese embroidery, as a creative hobby, provides deep relaxation (flow experience) while also bringing strong sense of accomplishment and social positive feedback through sharing results** (August 23), constituting an important pillar of mental health.
