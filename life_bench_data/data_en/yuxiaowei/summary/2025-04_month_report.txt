    *   **Core Tags:** "Proactive Health Manager Under High Family Pressure", "Exercise Shifting from Event-Driven to Maintenance/Rehab", "Successfully Established New Eco-Friendly and Financial Habits".
    *   **Overall Health Rating:** **Good**. Despite significant caregiver stress and workload, physical and mental health remained stable with a positive trend through systematic rehabilitation exercise, family communication, and financial planning.
*   **Key Events:**
    *   **Fitness Milestone:** 12th, successfully completed the first half marathon of the year (21.1 km).
    *   **Injury:** 16th, exacerbated shoulder/neck strain due to long-term caregiving and work posture, underwent physiotherapy assessment.
    *   **Health Metric Fluctuation:** 5th, discovery of son's academic decline triggered strong self-blame and anxiety, leading to an emotional stress peak.
    *   **Major Life Change:** Continued mother's rehabilitation management throughout the month; 25th-27th, after family meetings and in-depth discussions with partner and brother, formally initiated the process of hiring a caregiver to alleviate caregiving pressure.
*   **Goal Completion Status:**
    *   **Set Goals:** (Inferred from annual goals and monthly events) Complete one half marathon; establish and maintain a shoulder/neck rehabilitation exercise habit.
    *   **Completion Rate:**
        *   Half Marathon: Successfully completed on the 12th, 100% completion.
        *   Rehabilitation Training: Completed 16 sessions for the month, with execution rate significantly increasing in late April (especially after the 16th strain), approx. 94% completion (only 3 days missed for specific reasons).
    *   **Reasons for Non-Completion:** Rehabilitation training missed on 3 days (3rd, 4th, 18th), due to social relaxation, fatigue from tomb-sweeping, and low energy after staying up late the previous night, respectively.
*   **Core Changes from Last Month:**
    *   **Exercise Volume:** (No last month data, considered as a new cycle start) This month's exercise mode clearly shifted from the previous stress-relief or race-prep model centered on running/yoga to a combination of **"Rehabilitative Stretching + Maintenance Running"**. Running distance decreased month-over-month due to post-race recovery, but total exercise frequency remained high due to daily rehab practice.
    *   **Health Metrics:**
        *   Weight: Start-of-month 54.2kg → End-of-month 54.0kg, overall slight decrease of 0.2kg, mid-month peak of 55.3kg (after family gathering on 20th), fluctuations reflect stress-related and social eating influences.
        *   Sleep: Inferred average daily sleep approx. 6.5 hours, with slight catch-up on weekends. Sleep duration and quality fluctuated noticeably, affected by work-related late nights (11th, 17th, 24th) and family concerns.
    *   **Life Rhythm:** Life focus underwent significant adjustment. Early month centered on mother's rehabilitation; mid-month (after 5th) increased parent-child interaction and academic tutoring time due to son's school issues; end-of-month initiated caregiver hiring process, attempting to restructure family responsibility division. Increased environmental awareness, habit of bringing own lunchbox solidified from trial.
*   **Core Focus Areas:**
    *   Focus on progress and daily relief of shoulder/neck strain rehabilitation.
    *   Core need is maintaining emotional stability and sleep quality under high pressure (work, caregiving, parenting).
    *   Focus on building personal and family health risk buffers through regular exercise (especially rehab stretching) and new financial management methods (fund regular investment).

### **Module 3: Monthly Trend Analysis**

#### **3.1 Exercise Trends**
*   **Weekly Exercise Volume Changes:**
    *   **Week 1 (1st-6th):** Moderate exercise volume, primarily daily rehab stretching, one 5km easy run on weekend. Final tapering for half marathon.
    *   **Week 2 (7th-13th):** Exercise volume peaked. Included half marathon (21.1km) and post-race parent-child jog (3km), rehab stretching throughout the week. Exercise duration and intensity highest for the month.
    *   **Week 3 (14th-20th):** Exercise volume decreased, entered post-race recovery period. Primarily rehab stretching, only one 10km morning run (19th). Exercise focus shifted to targeted relief for shoulder/neck strain.
    *   **Week 4 (21st-30th):** Exercise volume stabilized. Maintained daily or every-other-day rehab stretching rhythm, no long-distance running. Exercise fully integrated into daily life rhythm, serving body maintenance.
*   **Training Cycle Peaks/Valleys:**
    *   **Peak Week:** Week 2. Exercise performance marked by successful half marathon completion, exercise confidence and emotional benefits peaked.
    *   **Valley Week:** Week 3. Shoulder/neck strain event (16th) brought physical discomfort, exercise focused on conservative rehab, running activity reduced.
*   **Exercise Performance Changes:** Running performance showed a typical cycle of "pre-race taper - race completion - post-race recovery". Consistency and precision of rehab stretching improved as the month progressed, especially after physiotherapy on 16th, with more targeted movements.

#### **3.2 Health Trends**
*   **Sleep Trends:**
    *   **Duration & Quality:** Weeks 1 & 2 sleep relatively regular; Week 3 saw sleep duration shortening and quality fluctuations due to work late nights (17th) and family worries (20th); Week 4 sleep stabilized as psychological pressure eased somewhat after initiating caregiver search process.
    *   **Sleep Continuity:** Late-night days (e.g., 11th, 17th, 24th) were typically followed by mental fatigue the next day, affecting daytime work focus and exercise motivation.
*   **Physical Health Trends:**
    *   **Weight:** Weeks 1-2 stable; Week 3 significantly increased (peak 55.3kg) due to stress eating and family gathering; Week 4 successfully decreased (to 54.0kg) through dietary attention and continued exercise.
    *   **Body Fat Percentage/Body Sensation:** Weight fluctuations synchronized with body fat sensation. Shoulder/neck discomfort peaked in Week 3, reported "stiffness reduced" by end of Week 4 after targeted rehab.
    *   **Psycho-Physical Link:** High-stress events (e.g., 5th) often triggered emotional eating, leading to short-term weight increase. After receiving effective social support (e.g., 13th, 27th), mood improved, aiding weight management return.
*   **Mental Health Trends:**
    *   **Stress Curve:** Stable early month; spiked sharply on 5th due to family crisis; eased on 12th-13th due to race success and parent-child interaction; rose again on 16th-18th due to physical strain and workload; showed a slow downward trend after 25th due to initiating caregiver plan and gaining family consensus.
    *   **Exercise & Mental Health Link:** **Regular rehab stretching** and **mindful breathing** became the most stable mood regulators this month. Completing the half marathon brought strong short-term sense of achievement. Exercise break days (e.g., 3rd, 4th) did not lead to increased stress, indicating social relaxation is also an effective stress relief method.
*   **Injury Impact:**
    *   **Event:** 16th shoulder/neck strain underwent physiotherapy assessment.
    *   **Impact:** Directly led to pause of high-intensity exercise (e.g., running) that day and subsequent days, shifting exercise focus entirely to low-intensity rehab practice. Possibly accompanied by discomfort during sleep, affecting rest quality.
    *   **Recovery:** Through consistent stretching guided by physiotherapist, adjusting work posture, using aids (lumbar support, heat pack), discomfort was effectively controlled by month-end.

#### **3.3 Life Rhythm Trends**
*   **Routine & Mental State:** Data shows that on **days when bedtime exceeded 23:30**, next-day self-reported mental state was often "tired", "slightly busy". For example, after staying up until 01:30 on 17th, 18th was described as "low energy" all day with rehab stretching cancelled. Routine stability is the foundation of daytime effectiveness.
*   **Work/Life Rhythm Changes:**
    *   **Work Intensity Changes:** Concentrated overtime occurred in latter half of Week 2 (11th) and Week 3 (17th, 24th) preparing client proposals, directly squeezing sleep and personal time.
    *   **Life Change Impact:** Week 4 initiated the decision-making process for the major life adjustment of "hiring a caregiver". Anxiety before the decision (26th) and relief after (27th) formed a stark contrast. This process consumed significant cognitive resources but is crucial for long-term life rhythm optimization.

### **Module 4: Personalized Insights**

*   **Sleep ↔ Exercise Performance:** Your data shows that **on days following sufficient emotional support or completion of a major goal (e.g., 13th, 27th), subjective sleep quality feels better, and willingness/quality of morning exercise (rehab stretching or morning run) is higher.** Conversely, **on days after working late (e.g., 18th), even if time is available, there is a tendency to cancel planned exercise, manifesting as "resting early due to fatigue".**
*   **Stress/Family Events ↔ Health:**
    *   **Family stress events** were the core driver of health fluctuations this month. The 5th son's academic issue triggered a
