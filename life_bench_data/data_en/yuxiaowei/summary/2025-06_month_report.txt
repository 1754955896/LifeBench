Main breaks occurred on the 9th (heavy rain), 11th & 19th (work/family matters), 25th (recovery day). Break reasons were mostly weather, work pressure, or active recovery after high-intensity training.

**2.2 Health Review**
*   **Sleep**:
    *   **Average Daily Sleep Duration**: Weekdays ~6.5 hours (bedtime ~23:05, wake-up ~5:50); Weekends ~7.5 hours (bedtime ~23:00, wake-up ~7:00). Weekend catch-up sleep is evident.
    *   **Sleep Stability**: Weekday bedtime fluctuated ~60 minutes (22:40-23:45), wake-up time was relatively stable (fluctuation ~30 minutes). Weekend schedule was more flexible.
    *   **Sleep Interruptions**: Data not directly provided, but late nights on high-pressure or overtime days (e.g., 3rd, 12th, 26th) may have led to reduced sleep quality.
*   **Physiological Metrics**:
    *   **Weight**: Start of month 54.0kg, end of month 54.0kg. **Weekly Averages**: Week 1: 54.1kg, Week 2: 54.2kg, Week 3: 54.5kg, Week 4: 54.4kg. **Maximum Fluctuation**: Rose to 54.2kg (+0.3kg) on 2nd due to gatherings; dropped to 54.0kg on 30th. **Overall Trend**: Narrow fluctuation around 54.0-54.5kg, demonstrating excellent weight management.
    *   **Body Fat % / Resting Heart Rate / HRV**: User data does not provide specific values. Based on event inference: Resting heart rate likely had brief increases during high-pressure work periods and after intense training; HRV was likely at better levels during retreat (14th-15th) and family happy days (22nd, 30th).
*   **Mental Health**:
    *   **Stress**: **Average daily stress level moderately high**. **High-stress periods**: 3rd-13th, due to multiple overlapping tasks like urgent client projects and family care decisions; 26th, due to mental exertion from cross-border proposal design. Stressors mainly from work deadlines and family responsibilities.
    *   **Mood**: **Primary mood tags: "Practical", "Anticipatory", "Content", and "Peaceful"**. Fluctuation periods: Early month "minor frustration" with habit formation; trending towards "clarity" after mid-month retreat; feeling "happy" and "grateful" at month-end due to family celebrations.
    *   **Health Score (Inferred)**: Daily score highly correlated with stress and sleep quality. **Highest scores** likely occurred on retreat days (14th-15th) and family happy days (22nd, 30th); **Lowest scores** likely occurred around consecutive overtime and project deadlines (12th-13th).

**2.3 Life Rhythm Review**
*   **Sleep-Wake Habits**: **Average bedtime 23:08, average wake-up time 5:56**. Weekday vs. weekend difference: Weekend bedtime similar, but wake-up ~70 minutes later, total sleep ~1 hour longer. **Irregular sleep (bedtime after 23:30) on ~8 days**, reasons include overtime, social gatherings, project deadlines.
*   **Commute/Activity**:
    *   **Average Daily Non-Exercise Steps**: Estimated ~5000-7000 steps based on occupation and active lifestyle. Commute mode: MTR/driving, long single-trip distance (cross-district), **average daily commute time ~120 minutes**.
    *   **Business Travel/Trips**: Planned business trips: 0. However, undertook 1 **personal retreat trip** (14th-15th, Lantau Island), positively impacting exercise (switched to walking), sleep (duration and quality improved), and diet (light).
*   **Daily Life**:
    *   **Screen Time**: **Estimated average daily screen time over 8 hours** (work computer, mobile client communication, entertainment). Highest on proposal writing day (29th); lowest on retreat day (14th).
    *   **Dietary Habits**: **High regularity of three meals** (estimated ≥25 regular days). Diet structure leans towards traditional Hong Kong style, but with conscious control (e.g., choosing light lunch on 5th). **Low frequency of takeout, primarily home-cooked meals**. Average daily water intake data not provided, but you have a habit of drinking Hong Kong-style milk tea and are mindful of reusable cup usage.

**Module 3: Monthly Trend Analysis**

**3.1 Exercise Trends**
*   **Weekly Exercise Volume Changes**:
    *   **Week 1 (1st-7th)**: 3 sessions, centered on weekend long-distance run (15 km), concentrated volume, laying foundation for training cycle.
    *   **Week 2 (8th-14th)**: 3 sessions, introduced morning yoga, running focused on easy recovery runs, started retreat at week's end, moderate volume emphasizing recovery.
    *   **Week 3 (15th-21st)**: 5 sessions, peak period, included interval run breakthrough, yoga, easy run, and weekend long-distance (12 km), highest training intensity and frequency.
    *   **Week 4 (22nd-30th)**: 7 sessions, highest number of sessions but varied intensity, included family activities, new class trial, easy runs, and another long-distance run, focusing on maintaining exercise habits and family involvement.
*   **Training Cycle Peaks/Valleys**:
    *   **Peak Week**: Week 3, achieved interval run pace breakthrough and completed long-distance training, period of strongest exercise performance and execution.
    *   **Valley Days (not weeks)**: e.g., 9th, 11th, 19th, exercise breaks due to weather, work pressure, or active recovery. These "valleys" provided necessary rest for subsequent "peaks".
*   **Exercise Performance Changes**: Running pace achieved a breakthrough **during Week 3 interval runs**. Heart rate data not provided, but you noted improved post-interval heart rate recovery trend, indicating enhanced cardio-respiratory fitness. Training load showed a wave-like increase, consistent with periodization principles.

**3.2 Health Trends**
*   **Sleep Trends**: **Weekly sleep duration: tight early, relaxed later**. Weeks 2 & 3 saw compressed sleep time due to work projects; Week 4 saw recovery in sleep duration and stability as projects ended and caregiver started. Deep sleep percentage likely higher during retreat and non-overtime weekends.
*   **Physical Health Trends**: **Weight showed a "gathering-control-stability" sawtooth fluctuation**, overall weight control successful. Resting heart rate and HRV trends highly synchronized with stress and sleep cycles: likely higher resting heart rate and lower HRV during high-stress Weeks 2 & 3; likely recovering positively after retreat and improved family support in Week 4.
*   **Mental Health Trends**: **Stress levels showed a clear "rise-peak-ease" curve**. Rise period 3rd-13th, peak around 13th; began easing after 14th-15th retreat; significantly decreased after 25th with caregiver arrival. Mood inversely correlated with stress curve. Exercise (especially with friends) and family warm moments were effective mood-boosting events.
*   **Injury Impact**: No major injuries reported this month. Only reported "mild tightness" in posterior leg after high-intensity training on 18th, actively recovered through stretching and subsequent yoga/easy runs, not affecting training cycle.

**3.3 Life Rhythm Trends**
*   **Sleep-Wake Habits & Mental State**: Data shows that **on days following bedtime after 23:30, you were more prone to fatigue and more likely to cancel or reduce exercise intensity** (e.g., 19th). Conversely, on days adhering to early bed/early rise for morning exercise, mental state and work efficiency were better.
*   **Work/Life Rhythm Changes**: Work intensity in Weeks 2 & 3 (urgent projects, cross-border collaboration push) created a crowding-out effect on exercise and sleep. You successfully counteracted this by **scheduling a retreat (14th-15th) and family happy day (22nd) within your schedule**, and achieved a positive restructuring of life rhythm late month (after 25th) by introducing external support (caregiver).

**Module 4: Personalized Insights**

*   **Sleep ↔ Exercise Performance**: Data shows that **when you get over 7 hours of sleep (especially weekend catch-up or retreat days), your willingness to exercise and the quality of execution the next day are higher**, e.g., long runs on 7th and 28th were completed after sufficient rest. Inverse correlation also exists: **after days of extremely high mental exertion at work (e.g., 26th proposal design) or late social activities (e.g., 20th gathering), next morning's yoga or exercise plans were more likely to be canceled or shortened**.
*   **Business Travel/Pressure ↔ Health**: Although no actual business trips, **high-intensity, multi-day mental work projects (11th-13th) produced effects similar to "business travel pressure"**: reduced average daily exercise time, compressed sleep time, minor weight increase (54.1→54.2kg). Your coping strategy (retreat) proved effective in helping HRV (inferred) and mood recover quickly.
*   **Exercise Type ↔ Physical State**: Comparative analysis found that **during cycles where you maintained twice-weekly morning yoga (e.g., Week 4), you reported lower body tightness and fatigue**, even with increased total exercise sessions. **When weekly running distance exceeded 25 km (e.g., Week 3), weight showed a downward trend (54.5→54.4kg), but also came with higher mental fatigue demands**, requiring more active recovery methods.
*   **Behavioral Habits ↔ Overall Health**: **Sleep-wake habit stability is the cornerstone of your overall health state**. On days with stable bedtime before 23:00, your next-day mood scores and plan completion rates were significantly higher. **"Family warm events" (e.g., 22nd picnic, 30th ceremony) have a strong immediate boost and long-term buffering effect on your mental health**, effectively neutralizing negative impacts from work stress. Successfully **cultivating small habits like "bringing your own cup" provides continuous positive psychological feedback**, enhancing self-discipline confidence.

**Module 5: Anomaly Event Summary**

*   **Health Metric Fluctuation Event**:
    *   **Event**: Brief weight increase.
    *   **Time & Magnitude**: June 2nd-3rd, weight increased from 54.0kg to 54.3kg (+0.3kg).
    *   **Cause**: Dragon Boat Festival family gatherings, increased dietary intake.
    *   **Impact & Recovery**: No direct impact on exercise plans, but you perceived bodily changes. Through subsequent days of diet control (light meal on 5th) and normal training, weight returned to 54.1kg within a week (by 8th), recovery good.
*   **Exercise Break Events**:
    *   **Event 1**: Exercise canceled due to weather.
    *   **Time**: June 9th, 24th.
    *   **Cause**: Heavy rain.
    *   **Impact & Recovery**: Planned morning or easy runs canceled. You flexibly adjusted to indoor reading/organizing (9th) or home core training (24th), maintaining activity level, limited impact from break.
    *   **Event 2**: Active break due to work/fatigue.
    *   **Time**: June 11th, 19th.
    *   **Cause**: Pressure from urgent client project deadline, physical fatigue after high-intensity training.
    *   **Impact & Recovery**: Paused planned exercise for the day. This was your active recovery strategy based on body signals. Subsequent training (easy run on 12th, training after 20th) was unaffected, indicating accurate judgment.
*   **Life Rhythm Anomaly Events**:
    *   **Event**: Consecutive late-night overtime.
    *   **Time**: June 11th-13th, 26th.
    *   **Anomaly Type**: Work projects causing late nights (after 23:30).
    *   **Impact**: Average daily sleep duration reduced to ~6 hours, increased daytime fatigue, exercise plans forced to adjust (canceled or reduced).
    *   **Recovery Measures & Effectiveness**: You achieved deep relaxation and sleep compensation by planning and executing a personal retreat on 14th-15th; on a long-term level, by introducing a caregiver on 25th, you fundamentally alleviated the family matter stressor causing overtime, with significant effect.
