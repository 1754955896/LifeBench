Estimated average daily water intake 1.5-2.0 liters (including Hong Kong-style milk tea).

**Module 3: Monthly Trend Analysis**
**3.1 Exercise Trends**
*   **Weekly Exercise Volume Changes**:
    *   Week 1 (1st-7th): Low exercise volume (3 sessions), focused on family activities and plan formulation, running not initiated.
    *   Week 2 (8th-14th): Exercise volume noticeably rebounded (6 sessions), initiated running and strength training, completed first tempo run.
    *   Week 3 (15th-21st): Exercise volume maintained (5 sessions), but included one gap due to headache, initial test of training consistency.
    *   Week 4 (22nd-31st): Exercise volume peaked (9 sessions), training became more regular, completed 8 km long-distance run, showing good adaptability.
*   **Training Cycle Peaks/Valleys**:
    *   **Peak Week**: Week 4. Highest exercise frequency, completed single longest distance (8 km), strong training execution.
    *   **Valley Days**: May 6th, 18th. Exercise gaps, primary triggers being **emotional stress** (family meeting, multi-tasking concerns) rather than physical fatigue.
*   **Exercise Performance Changes**: Running distance steadily increased from 5 km in Week 2 to 8 km in Week 4. Pace performance strongly correlated with rest quality; running felt easier on days following sufficient sleep and low stress (e.g., May 25th).

**3.2 Health Trends**
*   **Sleep Trends**: Weekly sleep duration fluctuated influenced by social activities and work wrap-up. Week 1 (holiday) sufficient, Week 2 slightly reduced due to schedule, Weeks 3-4 stabilized. **Deep sleep quality strongly negatively correlated with stress levels**; subjective energy levels decreased the day after stressful events (May 6th, 18th).
*   **Physical Health Trends**: Weight showed a cyclical pattern of "mid-week slight increase due to socializing, weekend return to baseline through training and adjustment". End-of-month weight returned to start-of-month level, demonstrating excellent **energy balance control ability**. With regular training progression, cardiorespiratory fitness (estimated resting heart rate) should show positive improvement.
*   **Mental Health Trends**: Stress levels showed "event-triggered" fluctuations. Exercise, especially social runs with running partners (e.g., May 11th, 25th), had immediate and subsequent positive effects on stress relief. By month-end, with financial fund establishment and clear family responsibilities, psychological certainty increased, and stress baseline decreased.
*   **Injury Impact**: No exercise-related injuries reported this month. Mother's smooth recovery progress (May 25th follow-up) was a key event reducing caregiving pressure and indirectly enhancing personal exercise motivation and mental health.

**3.3 Life Rhythm Trends**
*   **Sleep Schedule & Mental State**: Data shows that on days following bedtime later than 23:30 (5 days total), 3 days experienced cancelled exercise plans or suboptimal state (e.g., May 6th, 8th, 22nd), indicating **late sleep negatively impacts next-day exercise execution**.
*   **Work/Life Rhythm Changes**: Work rhythm in Weeks 2-3 became **more flexible** due to work-from-home arrangements, aiding in managing family matters. Life rhythm in Week 4 became **more structured and family-oriented** due to family financial meetings and parent-child activity planning, promoting overall state stability.

**Module 4: Personalized Insights**
*   **Sleep ↔ Exercise Performance**: Your data shows that on days following ≥7 hours of sleep and no late sleep record (e.g., May 25th), exercise execution and completion quality were highest (successfully completed 8 km morning run). Conversely, following nights of late sleep due to overthinking or work (e.g., after May 22nd), the next day was more prone to lack of exercise motivation or fatigue.
*   **Travel/Pressure ↔ Health**: Short family trips (Shenzhen) had minimal impact on total sleep duration but caused exercise interruption and sudden dietary calorie increase, requiring 2-3 days of active adjustment upon return (like your recovery stretching on May 5th). **Dual pressure from work and family decisions (stress level ≥7/10) was the primary cause of exercise gaps this month**, not physical fitness issues.
*   **Exercise Type ↔ Physical State**: Comparison reveals that **core strength training twice or more per week** (as per your plan executed after May 7th) combined with running training effectively maintained weight stability and did not trigger significant hunger-induced weight gain despite increased running volume. **Social runs with running partners** not only achieved training goals but also provided additional emotional value, offering a "double benefit" for mental health.
*   **Behavioral Habits ↔ Overall Health**: The financial planning behavior of **establishing a dedicated family medical fund** (May 28-29th) significantly reduced anxiety about future uncertainty and was a key non-exercise factor in the late-month improvement in overall well-being. **Successfully cultivating the habit of using a portable cup**, though a small change, brought positive psychological cues of environmental identity and a sense of orderly life control.

**Module 5: Anomalous Event Summary**
*   **Exercise Gap Events**:
    *   **Gap 1**: May 6th. Cause: Emotional pressure from the "family meeting decision to try a caregiver" event. Impact: Planned exercise cancelled for the day. Recovery: Returned to normal the next day (May 7th) and completed core training.
    *   **Gap 2**: May 18th. Cause: Mild headache due to previous day's social fatigue and overthinking. Impact: No exercise for the day. Recovery: Adjusted with early sleep, state recovered the next day (May 19th), but no exercise scheduled until resuming activity with indoor aerobics on May 21st.
*   **Health Indicator Fluctuation Event**:
    *   **Event**: Single-day weight increase. Time: May 17th. Magnitude: +0.6kg compared to previous day (54.0→54.6kg). Cause: Explicitly recorded drinking and high-calorie food consumption (pineapple bun) during gathering with friends. Follow-up: Through normal diet the next two days and activity on May 19-20, weight dropped back to 54.4kg by May 20th, indicating the fluctuation was due to short-term dietary influence with effective regulatory mechanisms.
*   **Life Rhythm Anomaly Events**:
    *   **Event**: Consecutive late nights and work-related late hours. Period: May 22nd, May 27-28th. Type: Caused by client project wrap-up, filing organization, and family financial meetings. Impact: Temporarily compressed sleep time, potentially reducing recovery efficiency short-term. Recovery Measures: Proactively slept early on May 29th (22:30), engaged in psychological relaxation via family movie night on May 30th, returned to normal holiday sleep schedule by May 31st.
