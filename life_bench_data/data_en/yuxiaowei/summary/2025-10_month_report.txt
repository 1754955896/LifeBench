**Monthly Trend Analysis**

**3.1 Exercise Trends**
*   **Weekly Exercise Volume Changes**:
    *   Week 1 (Oct 1-6): 2 sessions, total 155 minutes. Low volume due to National Day & Mid-Autumn family holiday.
    *   Week 2 (Oct 7-13): 4 sessions, total 185 minutes. Increased 19.4% week-on-week, due to holiday end, new equipment purchase, renewed exercise motivation.
    *   Week 3 (Oct 14-20): 2 sessions, total 105 minutes. Decreased 43.2% week-on-week, due to time and mental resource allocation for community lecture preparation, reducing exercise frequency.
    *   Week 4 (Oct 21-31): 4 sessions, total 92 minutes (counted only until morning of 31st). Exercise frequency recovered to 4 sessions/week, strictly following the new health plan, demonstrating strong habit execution.
*   **Training Cycle Peaks/Valleys**:
    *   **Peak Week**: Week 2. Best exercise performance, completed longest single run (8 km) and tried new equipment, highest exercise enjoyment.
    *   **Valley Week**: Week 3. Lowest exercise volume and motivation, directly impacted by high-pressure work of lecture preparation.
*   **Exercise Performance Changes**:
    *   Running pace overall stable around 7'30". In Week 4, while executing the increased running plan, more focus was placed on the aerobic heart rate zone, with no significant pace improvement, indicating prioritization of training quality over speed.

**3.2 Health Trends**
*   **Sleep Trends**:
    *   Sleep duration: Longest in Week 1 (holiday), significantly shorter in Weeks 2 & 3 (work & stress), recovered by end of Week 4.
    *   Deep sleep percentage: Correlated with total sleep duration and stress levels, estimated to decrease 3-5% during Week 3 stress peak.
    *   Sleep continuity: Increased difficulty falling asleep and interruptions in Week 3 due to anxiety.
*   **Physical Health Trends**:
    *   Weight & Body Fat Percentage: Showed a continuous slow downward curve, slight rebound after Week 1 holiday, resumed downward trend after Week 2, accelerated decline in Week 4.
    *   Resting Heart Rate & HRV: Showed typical negative correlation. HRV decreased in Week 3 while RHR increased; HRV rebounded in Week 4 while RHR decreased.
*   **Mental Health Trends**:
    *   Stress Levels: Lower in Weeks 1 & 2 (3-4/10), peaked at 7/10 in Week 3, quickly dropped back to 2-3/10 in Week 4 through interventions like meditation and travel.
    *   Exercise & Mental Health Correlation: Data shows weekly average stress levels were significantly lower in Weeks 2 & 4 (high exercise frequency) compared to Week 3.
*   **Injury Impact**: Mild knee soreness reported on Oct 9 led to adjustments in that week's running plan (cancellation or reduced volume), replaced with stretching/rest. No long-term impact on monthly exercise, normal running resumed after Oct 16.

**3.3 Life Rhythm Trends**
*   **Sleep/Wake & Mental State**: Data shows that on days following bedtime after 23:30 (e.g., Oct 11, 18), mental state was described as "fatigued", with decreased exercise willingness or performance. Conversely, on days following regular early sleep (e.g., 22:30), morning run execution rate was 100%, with feelings of "mental clarity".
*   **Work/Life Rhythm Changes**: Work intensity surged in Week 3 (lecture prep, client meetings), directly causing a 50% reduction in exercise sessions, ~0.5 hour/day reduction in sleep, and increased screen time. Week 4 successfully achieved a reset and balance in life rhythm through active planning (finance meeting, health plan update, short trip).

**Personalized Insights**

*   **Sleep ↔ Exercise Performance**: Data shows that when your bedtime is before 22:30 and sleep duration ≥7 hours, the willingness and completion rate for a morning run the next day is as high as 100%. Conversely, on days following insomnia due to high stress (e.g., Oct 23), no dedicated exercise was recorded.
*   **Travel/Stress ↔ Health**: The short trip at month-end (a mini "business trip") had a positive impact on health: Sleep time on travel day (Oct 31, 22:30) was earlier than the monthly average, and mood rating was "romantic, relaxed". The high-pressure work cycle (Week 3) led to an average daily sleep reduction of ~0.5 hours, an estimated HRV decrease of 10 ms, and a stress level increase of 3 points.
*   **Exercise Type ↔ Physical State**: Comparison shows running is your core method for weight management and maintaining cardio-respiratory fitness; this month's weight loss highly coincided with periods of regular running. Yoga played an important role in physical and mental recovery: when feeling "fatigued" (Oct 19) or experiencing "mild knee discomfort" (Oct 9, 15), you actively chose yoga for soothing and stretching.
*   **Behavioral Habits ↔ Overall Health**: This month you demonstrated strong planning and execution abilities, which directly promoted health. For example: After making practical decisions in the "Family Finance Meeting" (Oct 27), your "mood" shifted to "rational and determined", and the subsequent week's (Week 4) exercise plan execution reached 100%. Furthermore, the diet pattern dominated by "home-cooked meals", combined with regular exercise, formed the important foundation for the steady decline in weight and body fat percentage.

**Abnormal Event Summary**

*   **Injury Event**: October 9th, mild knee soreness occurred. Impact scope: adjustment of that week's running training plan, replaced with consulting running friends and stretching/rest. Recovery was good, normal running resumed on Oct 16, and subsequent running records did not mention knee discomfort again.
*   **Exercise Gap Events**:
    *   Oct 1-3: 3 consecutive days due to National Day holiday family activities.
    *   Oct 11: 1 day due to typhoon warning cancelling outdoor run.
    *   Oct 22-24: 3 consecutive days due to stress from Shenzhen client meeting and lecture preparation anxiety.
    *   Post-gap recovery performance: After each gap, you actively recovered through social runs, executing new plans, etc., without long-term slack.
*   **Health Metric Fluctuation Events**:
    *   **Stress Level Fluctuation**: Oct 10th, staying up late for lecture prep caused a sharp stress increase, leading to "fatigued" state the next day. You intervened by seeking family support, consulting a doctor, and trying mindfulness meditation (Oct 23rd). Stress levels significantly decreased after the successful lecture on Oct 25th.
    *   **Sleep Fluctuation**: Oct 22nd, insomnia due to client meeting stress severely reduced sleep quality. You regulated by testing the lecture venue early (Oct 24th), using VR device for relaxation, etc., and sleep normalized after lecture completion (starting Oct 25th).
*   **Life Rhythm Anomaly Events**:
    *   Oct 17th: Staying up until 00:30 handling urgent emails after lecture led to insufficient sleep. Impact was next day's (18th) mental state, but you compensated with efficient Cantonese embroidery and work review during the day, and performed well at the evening gathering.
    *   Oct 20th: Late return from impromptu friend gathering (bedtime 23:50) broke the weekday routine. After this event, you paid more attention to maintaining a regular routine, significantly increasing early bedtime frequency in the following week.
