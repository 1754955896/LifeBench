Don’t just create a single pattern; instead, develop a series, such as a \"Lingnan Fruits\" series featuring lychee, longan, wampee, and star fruit.\n2. The style must be simple and modern, aligning with the aesthetic preferences of young people, and should avoid being overly traditional or intricate.\nThis advice was truly eye-opening for me.
