  "experience_desc": "Born and raised in Kowloon City, Hong Kong, I have lived here my entire life and have never relocated my household registration. After graduating from high school in 2005, my first job was as a packaging worker (non-skilled laborer) in a factory, working as an employee. Through evening classes, I studied insurance knowledge and obtained my insurance agent qualification in 2010, joining AIA Hong Kong to transition into the insurance sales industry. With excellent communication skills and diligence, I gradually built my own client network, established a family in Hong Kong, and raised two children. My life journey reflects a career transition from grassroots labor to professional sales, as well as a life path rooted in the local community and dedicated to building a family.",

        "nickname": "Manager Li",
        "relation_description": "Li Guodong is an important client manager whom Yu Xiaowei met while working at AIA, serving at HSBC. The two became acquainted at an industry exchange conference in 2018 and established a stable cooperative relationship due to complementary business needs. When Yu Xiaowei’s clients have complex asset allocation or banking service requirements, she often refers them to Li Guodong; conversely, when Li Guodong’s clients need insurance planning, he prioritizes Yu Xiaowei. They communicate several times a month via phone or WeChat to exchange market information and client updates, and meet quarterly at a café in Wan Chai or Central to discuss collaborative projects and maintain their relationship. Although both work in Hong Kong’s financial sector, they serve different institutions, maintaining a professional and mutually beneficial partnership."
