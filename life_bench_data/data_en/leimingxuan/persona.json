When Lei Mingxuan's parents were busy with work, Auntie Zhu used to help take care of him. Now retired, Auntie Zhu leads a leisurely life and often chats with neighbors at the entrance of the alley or in the community garden. When Lei Mingxuan returns from work or goes out on weekends, he often runs into her and stops to exchange a few words, discussing the weather, community news, or the flowers and plants she grows. Occasionally, when Auntie Zhu makes Ningbo-style snacks, such as glutinous rice balls in fermented rice, she brings a bowl to the Lei family. They maintain a warm, everyday neighborly bond, with frequent interactions—almost daily greetings—making them a stable and familiar presence in the community life."
