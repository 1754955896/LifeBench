Next, while discussing health plans with his mother, he explicitly proposed the plan to learn first aid (Event 948). Then, during his lunch break, he searched for and watched a CPR review video, initiating his first aid knowledge learning (Event 950). In the afternoon, while brisk walking along the riverbank, he reviewed first aid knowledge, imagined responses to emergency situations, and combined exercise with learning (Event 954). In the evening, he systematically researched ways to register for Red Cross training and drafted a family health emergency plan, deepening his preparation for enrollment (Event 958).",

The two exchanged opinions on location, timing, and cooperation models, and agreed to hold another online meeting the following week. At noon on June 20, he consulted with relatives and friends in Hangzhou (his cousin Yang Fan, classmate Wang Lei, and former colleague Sun Yue) via WeChat and phone calls from a restaurant in the mall, paving the way for the pop-up store and gathering market advice. On the morning of June 22, based on the previous day’s inspection notes, he drafted and sent a letter of cooperation intent to the business email of the Hangzhou park from his home study. On the morning of June 23, during shop hours, he reviewed and responded to a positive email from the business department of Hangzhou Dongxin Hechuang Park, proposing a video conference on Wednesday afternoon for detailed discussions. On the afternoon of June 25, he held an online video conference with the project manager of Hangzhou Dongxin Hechuang Park in the shop’s rest area, where he detailed the pop-up store proposal and received a preliminary offer for an ideal mid-September slot from the park.",

    "answer": "In the morning, he performed approximately 15 minutes of ankle stability exercises and a single-leg standing balance test, feeling that his ankle stability was better than in previous days. At noon, he engaged in leg-focused strength training at the gym, including barbell squats and leg presses, and exchanged fitness tips with fellow gym-goers. Before bed, while reflecting on the day, he felt fulfilled and efficient for completing multiple tasks such as fitness and data analysis, and set an alarm for the next day to maintain consistency. These activities demonstrate his approach to managing health through daily rehabilitation exercises and regular workouts, particularly emphasizing recovery after an ankle injury, and integrating fitness into daily life to stay active.",

On the evening of June 2, he presented the initial plan for the shop’s themed corner to his parents, explaining the design concept and gaining their support. On June 3, he collaborated with his cousin Shen Jie and staff member Xiao Chen to set up the \"Urban Outdoor\" themed corner, which was officially completed and opened at 3 p.m. On its first day, it attracted customers and achieved successful sales. On June 5, during business hours, he collected customer feedback (such as suggestions to add functional-style accessories) and developed a refined plan to enhance display layers and create a small accessories showcase area based on the feedback. That evening, he shared the plan with Shen Jie. On the morning of June 6, he systematically organized the trial operation data from the past three days (June 3–5), including sales records, customer dwell time, and verbal feedback, and conducted a preliminary summary, concluding that the corner effectively enhanced the area’s appeal. On the morning of June 7, he held a phone conference with Shen Jie to thoroughly review the trial operation data and customer feedback.

The regularity was reflected in the fixed \"Billiards Night\" gatherings with friends every Wednesday (August 6th and 20th).
