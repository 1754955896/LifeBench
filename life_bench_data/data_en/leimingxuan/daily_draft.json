However, when the brown coffee liquid dripped into the sharing pot and released its aroma, he was filled with a sense of accomplishment. He tasted the first cup of coffee he had ever brewed himself. Although the flavor was not as balanced as that from a café, he could distinctly taste its unique notes, and knowing he had made it with his own hands made it taste exceptionally sweet.

Subsequently, Lei Mingxuan printed three copies of the finalized family emergency plan and placed them in the TV cabinet in the living room, on the bedside table in his parents’ bedroom, and in the drawer of his shop office, ensuring they are readily accessible at all times."

In the afternoon, he reviewed the online sales data and customer inquiry records from the period when his father was hospitalized. He noticed a decline in the conversion rate of inquiries, while the repurchase rate among existing customers remained stable. This prompted him to start contemplating how to optimize the emergency operation model of \"online-first, offline-supplementary\" in the future."

Seizing the opportunity, Lei Mingxuan proactively approached him and offered a cigarette (though Zheng Kai does not smoke). After exchanging a few casual words, Lei steered the conversation to the main topic. \"Manager Zheng, does the mall have any unified summer promotion plans for July?\" Zheng Kai nodded, took out his phone to check internal notifications, and briefly introduced the \"Summer Shopping Carnival\" event scheduled for mid-to-late July, which included discounts for reaching certain spending thresholds, prize draws, and possible extended nighttime business hours. As Lei listened, he mentally calculated the details and inquired thoroughly about the registration process, cost-sharing rules, and promotional resource support. Zheng Kai mentioned that the specific plan details would be distributed in a couple of days and advised Lei to keep an eye on the property management notification group. This proactive communication laid the groundwork for Lei Mingxuan’s subsequent development of a participation plan."

Zhou Tao proposed that a cultural and creative park in Hangzhou, with which he collaborates, plans to launch a \"trendy market\" targeting young people during the summer vacation. He mentioned that there was a favorable stall available and asked whether Lei Mingxuan would be interested in collaborating to open a one-month summer pop-up store. Zhou Tao elaborated on the cooperation model (he would handle venue negotiations and some local coordination, while Lei Mingxuan would be responsible for goods and operations), estimated daily foot traffic, cost-sharing arrangements, and marketing support provided by the park. Lei Mingxuan was intrigued by this unexpected proposal. He carefully reviewed the plan and became particularly interested in the points of \"testing the Hangzhou market,\" \"enhancing brand awareness,\" and \"leveraging the prime summer season.\" After closing in the evening, instead of heading home immediately as usual, he sat in the store's lounge area, studying the plan on his computer for a long time, repeatedly weighing the project's appeal and potential risks."

According to the outfit combinations he had previously planned, he ironed the clothes smooth and displayed them together with matching accessories from the jewelry section on prominent display tables and mannequins.

How much would logistics costs increase? Was hiring temporary staff in Hangzhou reliable? How could remote management be handled? Were the rental costs and profit-sharing ratios truly cost-effective?

The content covered the origin and spread of coffee, as well as the core differences between the two main coffee bean varieties, Arabica and Robusta, including their preferred growing environments, bean characteristics, and typical flavor profiles. He attentively watched the instructional videos and completed the online multiple-choice test at the end of the chapter, achieving a good score. This process satisfied his curiosity as an ESTP for new knowledge and fulfilled his need for theoretical preparation before hands-on learning."
