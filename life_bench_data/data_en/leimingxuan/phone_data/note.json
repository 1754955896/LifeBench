Scenarios like commuting, exploring shops, and weekend activities can be utilized. She believes this approach can better attract target customers in the same city who share a similar lifestyle. A distinctive account name and unified visual identity are needed.\n2. Regarding Offline Events: She mentioned the possibility of collaborating with some stylish boutiques for limited-time pop-up events with specific themes. For example, we could approach \"Frontier Box\" near Yanggao South Road, as their style is relatively youthful and avant-garde. Weekend foot traffic is also good there. We could plan a co-branded weekend, offering some exclusive outfit combinations or items.\nHer ideas are indeed very professional and gave me, who was feeling anxious, a much-needed boost of confidence.
