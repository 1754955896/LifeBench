    *   **Monthly Total**: Activity on ~22 days, total duration ~2100 minutes (35 hours). You demonstrated strong initiative, embedding diverse activities into a busy schedule.
*   **Health Status Summary**:
    *   **Health Score**: Estimated mental score at the beginning of the month (post May 5th checkup) was 6/10 (anxious, worried), improving to an estimated 8/10 (grounded, in control) by month-end. Monthly average ~7.5/10.
    *   **Core Tags**: "Health checkup crisis triggered systemic health awakening", "Diverse activities but inconsistent intensity", "Steady weight loss, family support became key".
    *   **Overall Health Rating**: **Good (Needs Improvement → Good)**. This month was a significant health turning point, transitioning from cognitive change to action implementation, with an overall positive trend.
*   **Key Events**:
    *   **Health Metric Shift**: On May 5th, receiving the checkup report revealing elevated total cholesterol, LDL, uric acid, and mild fatty liver, which became the catalyst for this month's health changes.
    *   **Activity Milestones**: May 12th, health plan initiated with the first morning run; May 24th, participated in an amateur billiards open tournament and advanced one round.
    *   **Injury**: May 14th, minor right calf gastrocnemius strain during basketball due to insufficient warm-up.
    *   **Major Life Change**: May 25th-28th, successfully adjusted family dietary habits, gained parental support, optimizing the environment for the health plan.
*   **Goal Completion Status**:
    *   **Set Goals**: Based on doctor's advice and personal plan, implicit goals were "Initiate and maintain regular activity" and "Adjust diet structure for weight loss".
    *   **Completion Rate**:
        *   Activity Initiation: Activity frequency significantly increased after May 12th, 100% completion.
        *   Weight Control: Starting weight 78.0kg, month-end 77.2kg, a decrease of 0.8kg, positive trend.
        *   Diet Adjustment: Family dinners became lighter by month-end, successful preparation of healthy meals, completion rate over 80%.
    *   **Reasons for Incompletion**: The activity plan was interrupted or adjusted due to work busyness (e.g., 13th), injury (week after 14th), and weather (18th, 25th), but you found alternatives (e.g., home training), showing good adaptability.
*   **Core Changes vs. Last Month**:
    *   **Activity Volume**: No precise data from last month. Based on your description of "daily activity habit", this month saw a qualitative leap in activity **structure** and **purpose** (activity for health). Activity types expanded from potentially just running to a combination including basketball and strength training.
    *   **Health Metrics**: Weight showed a clear downward trend (overall -0.8kg). Sleep duration was occasionally insufficient due to work (late-night planning, handling complaints) and social events, but stabilized in the latter part of the month. Mental stress transformed from initial checkup anxiety to execution pressure regarding career and family planning later in the month, a change in nature.
    *   **Life Rhythm**: Sleep schedule fluctuated significantly (8 days with bedtime past 00:00), mainly due to store affairs, pre-match preparation, and socializing. Screen time was extremely high (work + researching health/real estate/insurance info). No business trips/travel this month, but commute distance was short (home/store proximity), estimated average non-activity steps ~7000 steps/day (based on events).
*   **Core Focus Areas**: This month you frequently focused on **weight loss trend**, **post-activity physical response (especially strain recovery)**, and **integrating healthy eating into family life**. The core need is to improve abnormal checkup indicators through activity and dietary intervention.

**Module 2: Monthly Review**
*   **2.1 Activity Review**
    *   **Activity Overview**:
        *   By session percentage: Rehabilitation Walking (daily) > Billiards (22.7%) > Basketball (18.2%) > Running/Strength Training (~13.6% each) > Rollerblading (4.5%). Your activity mix balances interest (billiards, basketball), cardio (running, basketball), and strength supplementation.
        *   **Estimated Intensity Zone Distribution**: Z1 Low Intensity (rehab walking, billiards practice) ~45%; Z2 Moderate Intensity (steady-state run, regular basketball, rollerblading) ~40%; Z3 High Intensity (basketball competition, billiards matches, HIIT plan not executed) ~15%. Overall dominated by moderate-low intensity cardio and skill-based activities.
    *   **Activity Statistics & Best Performance**:
        *   **Running**: Total distance ~20km, average pace ~6'00"/km (estimated). Both longest single distance and fastest pace occurred on May 31st (morning run 50 min). Estimated average heart rate 145-155 bpm.
        *   **Basketball**: Total duration ~9 hours. Longest single session 2 hours (May 21st). Moderate-high intensity, a primary source of cardio and competitive activity this month.
        *   **Billiards**: Total duration ~14.5 hours. Longest single session 4-5 hours (May 24th match). This is not just an activity but a key social and mental health regulation method for you.
        *   **Strength/Core Training**: Total duration 120 minutes. Longest single session 30 minutes. Primarily home-based bodyweight training, aiming to enhance core and foundational strength.
        *   **Rollerblading**: Total duration 60 minutes. Single session 60 minutes (May 4th), moderate intensity, recreational cardio.
    *   **Activity Habit Preferences**:
        *   **High-Frequency Activity Days**: Saturday, Sunday (~18% each), followed by Wednesday, Friday. Related to your store hours and weekend social events.
        *   **High-Frequency Activity Times**: Evening (18:00-21:00, ~50%, e.g., basketball, billiards) and early morning (7:00-8:00, ~18%, e.g., morning run). You effectively utilize time after store closing and early mornings.
        *   **Activity Locations**: Yuanshen Sports Center (basketball), neighborhood & riverside (running/walking), billiards hall, home (strength training). Location choices are highly practical, closely integrated with daily routes.
        *   **Activity Consistency**: Longest consecutive activity streak was 6 days (May 12-17, including running, basketball, walking). Main breaks: May 7th (no dedicated activity), several days post-strain on May 14th with reduced intensity, May 24-25 (post-match adjustment). Break causes were primarily **work commitments**, **acute injury**, and **post-event recovery**.

*   **2.2 Health Review**
    *   **Sleep**:
        *   Average Daily Sleep Duration: ~6.5 hours on weekdays, ~7.5 hours on weekends. Overall sleep duration insufficient, especially on weekdays.
        *   Estimated Sleep Stage Distribution: Based on unstable schedule and frequent late nights, deep sleep percentage likely low (~20%), light sleep percentage high.
        *   Schedule Stability: Weekday bedtime fluctuated greatly (22:00 to 00:45), wake-up time relatively stable (07:15-08:00); weekend bedtime and wake-up time were later. This "social late-night" and "compensatory late-rise" pattern is typical.
        *   Sleep Interruptions: Based on event records (e.g., handling a complaint on May 17th), there were ~5-7 days this month with sleep interruptions due to work or overthinking.
    *   **Physiological Metrics**:
        *   **Weight**: Start 78.0kg, end 77.2kg, overall decrease 0.8kg. Weekly averages: Week 1 78.1kg, Week 2 78.0kg, Week 3 78.3kg (injury & eating out impact), Week 4 77.6kg. Largest fluctuation: Rose to 78.5kg (+0.7kg) on May 15th due to celebratory dinner, then recovered. Trend: Stable downward trend in the latter part of the month with healthy eating and regular activity.
        *   **Estimated Body Fat Percentage**: Based on weight loss and strength training, estimated decrease from ~28% to ~27.5%, change -0.5%. Muscle mass likely maintained due to activity.
        *   **Estimated Resting Heart Rate**: Daily average ~70 bpm. With increased cardio, month-end RHR may have slightly decreased vs. start (~72 bpm). Highest values likely occurred after late nights or high-stress days (e.g., May 10th, 20th).
        *   **Estimated HRV**: Overall trend related to stress and recovery. HRV likely increased on days with regular activity and sufficient sleep (e.g., May 31st); decreased on late-night, high-pressure days (e.g., May 19-20) and initial injury period.
    *   **Mental Health**:
        *   **Stress**: Estimated daily stress value 6/10. High-stress periods: May 5-7 (checkup anxiety, stress 8/10), May 20th (store anniversary & multitasking, stress 7/10), May 26th (pre-family meeting, stress 7/10). Stressors mainly from health crisis awareness, career planning, and family responsibilities.
        *   **Mood**: Primary mood tags were mixed fluctuations of "determination-anxiety-fulfillment-pleasure". Start dominated by "shock/determination", mid-month occasional "irritability" due to injury and busyness, mood shifted to "grounded" and "satisfied" in the latter part as plans materialized.
        *   **Estimated Health Score**: Daily score strongly correlated with stress, activity completion, and sleep quality. Highest score likely on May 31st (family gathering, regular activity, score 9/10); lowest on May 5th (received checkup report, score 5/10).

*   **2.3 Life Rhythm Review**
    *   **Sleep/Wake Habits**:
        *   Average Daily Bedtime: Weekdays ~23:50, weekends ~00:15. Average Daily Wake-up Time: Weekdays ~07:40, weekends ~08:30.
        *   Weekday vs. Weekend Difference: Weekend bedtime ~25 min later, wake-up ~50 min later, total sleep ~1 hour more on weekends.
        *   Disrupted Schedule Days: 8 days this month with bedtime past 00:00, mainly due to **late-night work planning** (10th, 30th), **researching information** (5th, 19th), and **social gatherings** (2nd, 24th).
    *   **Commute/Movement**:
        *   Average non-activity steps ~7000 steps/day. Highest step week was Week 1 (during shopping festival), lowest was Week 4 (weather & increased indoor work).
        *   Primary commute modes: walking or short drive, one-way distance short (home/store proximity), average daily commute <30 minutes.
        *   No business trips/travel this month.
    *   **Daily Life**:
        *   **Screen Use**: Estimated average total daily duration over 10 hours (work communication, online operations, researching health/real estate/insurance info, entertainment). Work and leisure screen use highly blended.
        *   **Dietary Habits**: Three regular meals on ~25 days (irregularity mainly due to late rise or work delays). Diet structure shifted from start-of-month "high oil/salt Shanghainese cuisine + eating out" to month-end "high protein (fish, chicken breast), more vegetables, moderate carbs". Takeout frequency decreased from mid-month, homemade healthy meals increased (e.g., 28th). Estimated average daily water intake below 1.5L, room for improvement.

**Module 3: Monthly Trend Analysis**
*   **3.1 Activity Trends**
    *   **Weekly Activity Volume Changes**:
        *   **Week 1 (1-7)**: Activity mainly daily movement and rollerblading, duration ~3 hours. Adjustment period due to holiday and receiving checkup report.
        *   **Week 2 (8-14)**: Activity volume increased significantly, duration ~8 hours. Included running initiation, basketball, billiards practice. Reason: Health plan officially launched.
        *   **Week 3 (15-21)**: Activity volume maintained, ~7.5 hours, but structure changed. Due to calf strain, running paused, basketball reduced, increased rehab walking and dedicated billiards practice. Showed positive adjustment post-injury.
        *   **Week 4 (22-31)**: Activity volume steadily increased to ~9 hours. Basketball resumed regularity, strength training added, month-end completed a long morning run. Indicates body recovering from injury, activity habits getting on track.
    *   **Training Cycle Peaks/Valleys**:
        *   **Peak**: Week 4, activity performance fully recovered, running distance and basketball duration reached highs, no injury discomfort.
        *   **Valley**: Mid Week 3 (14-18), due to calf strain, cardio intensity and volume dropped to low point.
    *   **Activity Performance Changes**:
        *   **Running**: From 30-minute slow run in Week 2 to completing a 50-minute steady-state run in Week 4, endurance and confidence clearly improved.
        *   **Basketball**: Strain in Week 2 due to insufficient warm-up; Weeks 3-4, through rehab and regular play, fitness and teamwork feeling earned teammate recognition (invited to team on 21st). Performance closely linked to **adequate warm-up** and **consistent training**.

*   **3.2 Health Trends**
    *   **Sleep Trend**: Weeks 1-2 sleep duration fluctuated greatly, quality unstable; Week 3 more late nights due to injury and affairs; Week 4, especially final days (28-31), with deliberate schedule adjustment, sleep duration and quality improved. Sleep continuity easily interrupted by work on high-pressure days (17th, 26th).
    *   **Physical Health Trends**:
        *   **Weight**: "Stepwise" decline. Slight decrease Weeks 1-2, slight rebound Week 3 due to injury and socializing, accelerated decline Week 4 with healthy eating and regular activity.
        *   **Estimated Body Fat Percentage**: Trend largely synchronized with weight, but decline rate possibly slightly slower than weight in the latter part due to added strength training, suggesting fat loss while possibly preserving muscle.
        *   **Estimated Resting Heart Rate & HRV**: Showed negative correlation. E.g., Week 2 activity initiation, RHR may have temporarily increased (body adaptation), HRV fluctuated; Week 4 with regular activity, RHR showed downward trend, HRV increased on rest days.
    *   **Mental Health Trend**: Stress values formed two peaks at month start (post-checkup) and mid-month (multiple decision points). Mood shifted from "anxiety-driven" to "achievement and control-driven". Data shows **when activity (especially social activities like basketball, billiards) was executed, same-day mood score and next-day stress tolerance improved**.
    *   **Injury Impact**: May 14th right calf strain. Direct impact: Week 3 cardio volume and intensity reduced ~40%, possibly causing elevated RHR and decreased sleep quality that day. You actively responded with rehab walking and adjusted activity types, basketball largely unaffected by ~7 days later (May 21st).

*   **3.3 Life Rhythm Trends**
    *   **Schedule & Mental State**: Data shows when bedtime was before 23:30 (e.g., 3rd, 6th, 31st), next-day mental state described as "focused", "energetic", activity plan execution rate high. Conversely, days bedtime past 00:30 (e.g., 10th, 16th, 19th), next-day prone to "fatigued", "slightly tired", decreased activity willingness or performance.
    *   **Work/Life Rhythm Changes**: Work intensity remained high, but stress nature changed. Week 2 stress from health crisis and store renewal; Week 4 stress from family planning (moving, insurance) and execution. In life, **the family support system was successfully activated in the latter part of the month** (diet adjustment, moving consensus), providing significant positive buffering for your health plan and mental load.

**Module 4: Personalized Insights**
*   **Sleep ↔ Activity Performance**: Your data shows **when sleep duration ≥7 hours and bedtime is stable, the willingness to persist and subjective experience of next-day morning runs or basketball is better**. E.g., early sleep on May 30th led to completing a 50-minute morning run on the 31st feeling "fitness significantly improved". Inverse correlation also holds: **after a single day of high-intensity or long-duration activity (e.g., 4-5 hour match on May 24th), if nutrition and relaxation aren't timely supplemented, it may lead to difficulty falling asleep or lighter sleep that night**.
*   **Stress/Decisions ↔ Health Behaviors**: A clear pattern emerged this month: **Major decisions or high-pressure events (e.g., checkup report, renewal negotiation, family meeting) temporarily elevate your stress, but subsequently trigger stricter execution of your health plan** (e.g., buying healthy food, scheduling activity, planning sleep). This is an ESTP action-taker's characteristic "stress conversion" mode, transforming anxiety into execution.
*   **Activity Type ↔ Physical State**:
    *   **Social Activities (Basketball/Billiards)**: Have a significant uplifting effect on your mental health. Data shows **after performing ≥2 such activities weekly, that week's mood stability and social satisfaction scores were higher**.
    *   **Regular Cardio (e.g., Running/Walking)**: Strongest correlation with weight loss trend. Weeks adhering to ≥3 cardio sessions (even just walking) showed clearer weight loss trends.
    *   **Strength Training
