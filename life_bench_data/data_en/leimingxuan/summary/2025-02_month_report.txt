### **Module 3: Monthly Trend Analysis**

#### **3.1 Exercise Trends**
*   **Weekly Exercise Volume Changes:**
    *   **Week 1 (1st-7th):** 5 exercise sessions, primarily strength training. Pre-holiday sprint, concentrated exercise volume, building fitness reserves for the holiday.
    *   **Week 2 (8th-14th):** 3 exercise sessions, including cardio, skating, and one strength session. Spring Festival holiday, exercise frequency slightly decreased but maintained, focus shifted to cardio expenditure and leisure exercise.
    *   **Week 3 (15th-21st):** 5 exercise sessions, combining strength and cardio. Post-holiday recovery period, exercise volume quickly rebounded to high levels to regain state and cope with work pressure.
    *   **Week 4 (22nd-28th):** 3 exercise sessions (including post-injury adjustment). Due to injury on 23rd, later exercise adjusted to low-intensity upper body training and recovery jogging, resulting in reduced exercise volume.
*   **Training Cycle Peaks/Troughs:**
    *   **Peak Week:** Week 3. Exercise sessions recovered to 5, and post-workout weight on 21st reached monthly low (78.9 kg), indicating strong exercise efficacy.
    *   **Trough Week:** Latter part of Week 4. Affected by ankle sprain on 23rd, limiting exercise intensity and type.
*   **Exercise Performance Changes:** Your exercise performance strongly correlates with life rhythm. Solid strength training pre-holiday; Cardio became the mainstay during the holiday; Excellent comprehensive training state post-holiday; Adaptive adjustments at month-end due to injury. Exercise serves as a stabilizer for you in coping with life rhythm changes.

#### **3.2 Health Trends**
*   **Sleep Trends:** Sleep duration significantly increased during the holiday (Week 2), but bedtime fluctuated greatly. In Week 3 post-holiday return to work, sleep duration returned to workday levels, but sleep quality may have been affected by concern for father's health. In Week 4, as father's medical plan became clear and psychological pressure eased, sleep stabilized.
*   **Physical Health Trends:**
    *   **Weight & Body Fat:** Week 1 slight pre-holiday decrease; Week 2 mid-holiday slight rebound due to gatherings, but effectively controlled through exercise without significant bounce-back; Weeks 3 & 4 entered a sustained decline channel, achieving goal by month-end.
    *   **Resting Heart Rate & HRV:** Week 2 holiday relaxation period, resting heart rate likely lower, HRV higher; Week 3 showed rising trend in resting heart rate and HRV under pressure due to work stress and family concern; Week 4 later part saw indicators stabilize as issues resolved.
*   **Mental Health Trends:** Stress levels formed two minor peaks: end of Week 1 (pre-holiday tasks) and beginning of Week 3 (father's health issue). Mood reached highs post-exercise, during warm family moments (e.g., 9th, 27th), and upon goal achievement (28th). **Data shows exercise is an effective mood regulation tool for you** (e.g., mood improved after training on 5th, 21st).
*   **Injury Impact:** **Left ankle mild sprain occurred on 23rd**, leading to inability to perform lower-body weight-bearing exercise for the subsequent 3 days (24th-26th), switched to upper body training and recovery jogging. This temporarily affected exercise diversity but did not cause long-term disruption to overall exercise habits.

#### **3.3 Life Rhythm Trends**
*   **Sleep Schedule & Mental State:** 8 days of late sleep (>00:00) this month. Descriptions of next-day mental state often included "tired", "slightly fatigued" (e.g., 5th, 16th, 19th). **On days with stable sleep schedule (asleep before 23:00), next-day descriptions were mostly "energetic", "alert"** (e.g., 18th), proving the decisive impact of regular sleep on daytime energy.
*   **Work/Life Rhythm Changes:** Week 2 completely switched to holiday mode, dense social gatherings; Week 3 was a week of "return-to-work adaptation & family responsibility" coexisting, work intensity resumed and new father's health issue added, making life rhythm most compact; Week 4 gradually returned to normalcy, handling developmental matters like cross-border collaboration.

### **Module 4: Personalized Insights**

*   **Sleep ↔ Exercise Performance:** Your data shows that **on days following sufficient sleep (>8 hours) and a regular schedule (e.g., early sleep on 18th), exercise willingness and execution are stronger**, such as achieving the first post-holiday morning run on the 18th. Conversely, following staying up late (e.g., 4th) or late sleep (e.g., 16th), there were either no exercise records or only low-intensity activities the next day.
*   **Family Stress ↔ Health Behaviors:** The stress arising from your father's health issue this month did not lead to a slackening in your health behaviors. Instead, **it prompted you to pay more attention to overall family health** (e.g., purchasing healthy ingredients on 20th, updating family medicine cabinet on 24th, accompanying for medical check-up on 25th), transforming stress into responsible action, which holds positive significance for long-term mental health.
*   **Exercise Type ↔ Physical State:** **Strength training is the core of your weight management and physique shaping**. The 8 strength sessions this month ran throughout, forming the basis for body fat percentage decrease. **Cardio (running/elliptical) is your flexible tool for dealing with gatherings and maintaining cardiovascular fitness**, playing a key role especially during the Spring Festival. **Interest-based exercises like inline skating perfectly blend socializing, leisure, and moderate-intensity workout**, enhancing exercise enjoyment.
*   **Behavioral Habits ↔ Overall Health:** **"Controlling food order during gatherings" (vegetables & protein first, then staples & meat) was the key behavioral habit for your successful weight management this month**, allowing you to enjoy socializing while minimizing the risk of caloric surplus. **The behavior of "utilizing holidays for inspiration exploration and learning" (e.g., exhibition visit on 8th, lecture on 22nd)** not only satisfied your personality needs for "stimulation" and "autonomy", but also brought new momentum to your career, forming a virtuous cycle of healthy living.
