The rain was heavy, requiring extra caution with safety measures. Lu Mingqiang operated an aerial work vehicle to ascend to the broken line, the rain beating down so hard he could barely keep his eyes open. Carefully, he used an insulated rod to remove the wet branch, and with the assistance of his coworkers, performed emergency wrapping and securing of the damaged line. After nearly four hours of intense work, power was restored to the affected area around one in the morning. Exhausted and chilled to the bone, he returned home, taking a quiet hot shower to avoid waking his family."

He proactively reported his recovery progress and the doctor's advice (avoiding heavy physical labor) to his supervisor Zhang Jianguo via phone call. After discussion and negotiation, Supervisor Zhang agreed that upon his return to work in May, Lu Mingqiang would temporarily be exempted from front-line heavy-duty tasks such as installation and emergency repairs. Instead, he would be assigned to oversee the on-site technical supervision and blueprint verification for a circuit renovation project in an old residential area in Xiuying District. Additionally, he would provide remote technical guidance via phone or WeChat for other projects. Lu Mingqiang was satisfied with this arrangement, as it allowed him to resume work while protecting his waist. Subsequently, he coordinated with his colleague Chen Jianguo to complete the handover of some of his responsibilities."

His father patted him on the shoulder and said, \"Qiangzi, you're thinking the right way. We are skilled workers, and our craftsmanship is our foundation. First, establish solid roots, and opportunities will come later. I support you.\" His father's understanding dispelled the last bit of hesitation in his heart."
