    "answer": "On the evening of June 9, Lu Mingqiang proactively visited Uncle Wang's home to inspect the old-fashioned chandelier in the living room. He initially determined that the flickering and unusual noise were caused by loose wiring terminals in the lamp holder and oxidized switch contacts. After performing some simple repairs, he recommended replacing it with a safer LED ceiling light and offered to help with the installation. On the evening of June 12, he returned to further examine the chandelier and discovered that the deformed metal spring in the lamp socket was causing poor contact. He temporarily reinforced it to restore lighting and once again suggested replacing it with an LED ceiling light, politely declining Uncle Wang's offer of compensation. On the evening of June 14, while at home, he received a call from Uncle Wang requesting assistance and agreed to help with circuit repairs the following morning. These acts of assistance showcased his professional skills in fault diagnosis and repair, as well as his warm-hearted, reliable, and helpful neighborly demeanor, thereby enhancing the sense of community belonging.",
