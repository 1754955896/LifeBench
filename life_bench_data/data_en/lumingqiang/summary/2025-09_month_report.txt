**Module 1: Monthly Overview**
*   **Basic Information**: Lu Mingqiang, 35 years old (Age group: 30-35), Male, Occupation: Power Engineering - Electrical Machinery Installation and Repair Worker.
*   **Total Exercise Volume**:
    *   Running: 3 sessions / 155 minutes / 15km
    *   Brisk Walking: 2 sessions / 80 minutes / ~6km
    *   Other (Kite Flying/Walking/Wrist Rehab): 4 sessions / ~150 minutes
    *   Total Monthly Exercise Volume: 9 sessions / 385 minutes. Your job itself involves significant heavy physical labor, constituting baseline activity beyond the dedicated exercise listed above.
*   **Health Status Summary**:
    *   **Health Score** (inferred from events): Early month (post-injury restart) 6/10 → End of month (stress relieved, exercise resumed) 7.5/10, monthly average ~6.8/10.
    *   **Core Tags**: "Successful wrist rehabilitation, exercise capacity restarted", "Weight and body fat both decreased, but mid-to-late month stress caused sleep fluctuations".
    *   **Overall Health Rating**: **Good**. Exercise recovery and body composition improvement are highlights, but the temporary impact of work stress on sleep indicates room for strengthening stress resilience and recovery capacity.
*   **Key Events**:
    *   **Fitness Milestones**: On the 6th, received doctor's clearance and formulated a systematic "Exercise Restart Plan"; On the 25th, completed the first post-injury 2km slow run test; On the 28th and 30th, successfully completed 5km runs, marking full recovery of exercise capacity.
    *   **Health Metric Anomaly**: From the 23rd to 25th, experienced persistent difficulty falling asleep for the first time due to project crunch and exam preparation stress.
    *   **Major Life Changes**: On the 1st, the family entered the "dual elementary school students" era, requiring schedule and chore adjustments; From the 15th to 26th, led the critical project for retrofitting old residential area electrical meter boxes, resulting in a sharp increase in work intensity and pressure.
*   **Goal Completion Status**:
    *   **This Month's Goals** (inferred from events): 1. Safely resume running; 2. Execute wrist rehabilitation exercises; 3. Control weight.
    *   **Completion Rate**: 1. Running recovery goal **fully achieved**, with stable 5km runs by month-end; 2. Rehabilitation exercises performed for ~15 days, interrupted for 4 days in weeks 3-4 due to work stress, completion rate ~80%; 3. Weight decreased from 69.3kg to 68.8kg, a drop of 0.5kg, goal achieved.
*   **Core Changes vs. Last Month** (inferred from profile and early-month events):
    *   **Exercise Volume**: Achieved **breakthrough growth** from "post-injury rest/walking" to "slow running recovery". Estimated running sessions increased from 0 to 3, running distance from 0km to 15km.
    *   **Health Metrics**: **Positive trend in weight and body fat** (body fat percentage decrease inferred from descriptions "increased core strength", "reduced lower back soreness"). However, **new challenges emerged in sleep quality**, with delayed sleep onset and reduced continuity in late month due to stress.
    *   **Life Rhythm**: **Work stress significantly increased month-over-month** (old residential area retrofit project). Commute and basic schedule remained stable, but leisure time was reallocated among exam prep, family duties, and new hobbies (photography).
*   **Core Focus Areas**: This month, your high-frequency focus areas were **complete recovery from wrist injury** and **steady restart of exercise capacity**. Additionally, starting in late month, **how to ensure sleep quality under high-intensity work and exam pressure** became a new focal point.

**Module 2: Monthly Review**
**2.1 Exercise Review**
*   **Exercise Overview**:
    *   Recorded 9 dedicated exercise sessions for the month. By session count: Running 33.3%, Brisk Walking 22.2%, Wrist Rehab Exercises 11.1%, Kite Flying/Walking 33.3%.

    *   **Exercise Locations**: Wanlvyuan Park (running, walking, kite flying, 6 sessions), home/neighborhood (rehab, walking, 3 sessions).
    *   **Exercise Consistency**: Longest consecutive exercise streak: **3 days** (Sep 13 run - Sep 14 walk - Sep 15 walk). Main break period: **Sep 19-24** (6 days total), due to extreme fatigue from the "old residential area retrofit project crunch", leading to voluntary pause of dedicated training.

**2.2 Health Review**
*   **Sleep**:
    *   **Average Daily Sleep Duration**: Weekdays ~6.5 hours (sleep onset ~23:15, wake-up ~6:15), weekends ~7.5 hours (sleep onset ~23:00, wake-up ~7:00). During late-month stress period (23rd-25th), average daily sleep <6 hours.
    *   **Sleep Stages**: Data missing. Inferred from descriptions like "difficulty falling asleep", "foot soak for sleep" that deep sleep percentage likely decreased significantly during stress period.
    *   **Schedule Stability**: Weekday sleep onset time fluctuated significantly (22:30 to 00:30+), range >2 hours; wake-up time relatively stable (06:00-06:30). Weekend schedule more relaxed.
    *   **Sleep Interruptions**: Not explicitly recorded, but likely experienced light, easily disturbed sleep during stress period.
*   **Physiological Metrics**:
    *   **Weight**: Early month 69.3kg, end of month 68.8kg, overall decrease 0.5kg. Weekly averages: Week 1 ~69.6kg, Week 2 ~70.0kg, Week 3 ~69.7kg, Week 4 ~69.2kg. Largest fluctuation: Sep 5 (69.8kg) to Sep 7 (70.1kg), +0.3kg, possibly related to weekend gatherings. **Trend: decreasing with fluctuations**.
    *   **Body Fat Percentage**: Data missing. Inferred slight possible decrease based on "reduced lower back soreness", "increased core strength", and weight loss.
    *   **Resting Heart Rate**: Data missing. Inferred likely elevated during work stress periods (e.g., Sep 22-23).
    *   **HRV**: Data missing.
*   **Mental Health**:
    *   **Stress**: Inferred average daily stress level medium (5-6/10). Weekly averages: Weeks 1-2 medium (5/10), Weeks 3-4 medium-high (7/10). **High-Stress Period**: Sep 22-25, stress level 7-8/10, sources: "old residential area retrofit project crunch" and "exam preparation".
    *   **Mood**: Predominant mood tags: "calm", "steady", "fulfilled". Mood fluctuation periods: Sep 23-25 (anxious, fatigued), Sep 18 & 28 (joyful, satisfied, due to positive feedback on photography).
    *   **Health Score**: Inferred from state descriptions, daily average ~6.8, highest scores 8 (Sep 7, 18, 30), lowest score 5 (Sep 23), highly correlated with stress and sleep events.

**2.3 Life Rhythm Review**
*   **Schedule Habits**:
    *   **Weekdays**: Average sleep onset 23:15, wake-up 06:15.
    *   **Weekends**: Average sleep onset 23:00, wake-up 07:30.
    *   **Difference**: Weekend wake-up ~75 minutes later than weekdays, total sleep ~1 hour longer.
    *   **Schedule Disruption**: Days with sleep onset after 23:30: ~12 days, with severe disruption Sep 23-25 due to stress. Main reasons: work overtime, exam study, and social exceptions.
*   **Commute / Activity**:
    *   **Non-Exercise Steps**: Data missing. Inferred based on commute mode (car/e-bike, 10 min one-way) and heavy physical job nature that daily non-exercise steps likely medium (~5000-7000), but may be higher on weekdays due to stairs, carrying, etc.
    *   **Commute**: Mode: car/e-bike, short one-way distance (~3-5km), average daily commute time ~20 minutes.
    *   **Business Travel/Trips**: None.
*   **Daily Life**:
    *   **Screen Time**: Average daily duration ~2-3 hours (work communication, exam study, photo sharing). Recreational screen time (e.g., phone browsing) likely increased during stress period (e.g., before 23rd), consciously reduced later (after 24th).
    *   **Dietary Habits**: High regularity for three meals (~25 days regular). Diet structure leans towards high protein (enjoys grilled fish, Hainanese chicken rice), moderate carbs. Recorded dining out/takeout this month: ~4 times (gatherings, exceptions), home-cooked meals dominant. Daily water intake data missing, but inferred adequate as a heavy laborer.
    *   **Key Events**: Integrated into Module 1.
    *   **Core Focus Areas**: Integrated into Module 1.

**Module 3: Monthly Trend Analysis**
**3.1 Exercise Trends**
*   **Weekly Exercise Volume Changes**:
    *   **Week 1 (1st-7th)**: Total exercise 2 sessions (slow run, brisk walk), adaptive recovery period, low volume.
    *   **Week 2 (8th-14th)**: Total exercise 3 sessions (run, brisk walk, rehab), increased 50% vs. previous week. Reason: Wrist cleared by doctor, formal execution of "Exercise Restart Plan".
    *   **Week 3 (15th-21st)**: Total exercise 2 sessions (work site inspection, brisk walk), decreased 33% vs. previous week. Reason: Project crunch started, massive work physical/mental exertion, squeezing out dedicated exercise time.
    *   **Week 4 (22nd-30th)**: Total exercise 3 sessions (run, attempted slow run, run), increased 50% vs. previous week. Reason: Project completed, stress relieved, resumed and consolidated running habit.
*   **Training Cycle Peaks/Valleys**:
    *   **Peak Week**: Week 4. Exercise performance-wise, achieved fastest pace of the month (6'30"/km) on the 30th, with running distance stable at 5km, marking full recovery.
    *   **Valley Week**: Week 3. Few exercise sessions, and rehab exercises skipped on the 19th due to fatigue. Trigger: peak work intensity.
*   **Exercise Performance Changes**: Running pace shows "recovery-improvement" trend. From early-month adaptive slow runs (~7'30"/km), to mid-month attempt (slower pace), to late-month stable at 6'30"-7'00"/km. Pace improvement positively correlates with wrist rehab progress, fitness recovery, and work stress relief.

**3.2 Health Trends**
*   **Sleep Trends**:
    *   **Weekly Changes**: Sleep duration and quality stable in Weeks 1-2; Starting Week 3, as project intensified, sleep duration began to compress; Reached nadir early Week 4 (23rd-25th) with difficulty falling asleep; Late Week 4 (after 26th) gradually recovered through active adjustments (foot soak, earlier bedtime).
    *   **Fluctuation Cause**: Directly driven by **work stress intensity**. Sleep continuity challenged during late-month stress period.
*   **Physical Health Trends**:
    *   **Weight**: Overall decreasing trend, but with minor rebounds after weekend social meals (e.g., end of Week 1, Week 4), indicating sensitivity of diet to your weight.
    *   **Body Fat Percentage/Body Sensation**: Positive trend, sensation of "reduced lower back soreness" appeared and persisted from Week 2, associated with consistent brisk walking and core exercises.
    *   **Correlation Analysis**: Week 3 with highest work stress saw fastest weight drop (69.9→69.6kg), possibly due to combined effect of high energy expenditure and slightly irregular diet (excessive dinner on 22nd).
*   **Mental Health Trends**:
    *   **Stress & Mood**: Stress levels completely synchronized with work project progress. Mood fluctuated between stress periods (anxiety) and interest-fulfillment periods (photo praise, family joy).
    *   **Exercise Correlation**: During Weeks 2 & 4 with regular exercise, mood descriptions often "refreshed", "fulfilled"; During Week 3 exercise break, mood included more "fatigued", "feeling stressed".
*   **Injury Impact**: Early month (before 6th) wrist injury in final rehab stage, limiting exercise types (only walking). After check-up clearance on 6th, no new injuries occurred, original injury had no negative impact on this month's exercise.

**3.3 Life Rhythm Trends**
*   **Schedule & Mental State**: Data shows that **when sleep onset is after 23:30, especially approaching or past 00:00** (e.g., 12th, 23rd), next-day mental state noticeably declines,表现为 "sluggish reaction", "difficulty concentrating". On days with sleep onset between 22:30-23:00 (e.g., 14th, 24th), next-day feeling was "steady", "composed".
*   **Work/Life Rhythm Changes**:
    *   **Work Intensity**: Week 3 to early Week 4 (15th-25th) was **high-intensity period** (old residential area retrofit crunch), leading to extended daily work hours, sustained mental tension, directly squeezing exercise and sleep time.
    *   **Life Changes**: No major negative life changes this month. **Positive changes** included developing new photography hobby, planning family celebration, which served as positive mood regulators during stress periods.

**Module 4: Personalized Insights**
*   **Sleep ↔ Exercise Performance**: Your data shows that **sleep quality (measured by ease of falling asleep) has a preceding impact on next-day exercise performance**. For example, after improving sleep via early bedtime and foot soak on Sep 24, the attempted slow run on the 25th felt "good"; whereas after severe insomnia on the 23rd, daytime on the 24th was "somewhat sluggish". Conversely, **moderate evening exercise (e.g., brisk walk) aids your nighttime relaxation, but high-intensity mental work in the evening (e.g., exam study) easily leads to difficulty falling asleep**.
*   **Business Travel/Stress ↔ Health**: Although you had no business travel, **the impact pattern of concentrated high-intensity work projects on health is similar to business travel**. Data shows that during the project crunch (Sep 22-25), your average daily sleep decreased by ~1.5 hours, active exercise halted, stress perception significantly increased, and compensatory behaviors like irregular eating (overeating or snacking) appeared. **When stress level ≥7/10, it significantly interferes with your sleep initiation mechanism, but has little short-term impact on the weight loss trend**.
*   **Exercise Type ↔ Physical State**: Comparison reveals that **regular low-impact aerobic exercise (brisk walking, slow running) is an effective way for you to alleviate work strain and control weight** ("reduced lower back soreness", "weight loss"). **Although simple, interrupting wrist rehab exercises for a few days induced "guilt", indicating your high adherence to systematic plans**. Weekend morning runs are not just physical training but also an important **social and stress-release channel** for you.
*   **Behavioral Habits ↔ Overall Health**:
    *   **Schedule**: **Stabilizing sleep onset time before 23:00 is a key threshold for maintaining next-day energy and emotional stability**. Days with sleep onset before 23:00 this month generally correlated with better next-day states.
    *   **Diet**: **The home-cooked meal dominant dietary pattern is the foundation for your steady weight loss**. Recorded instances of dining out/gatherings this month (Sep 5, 8, 26) were all accompanied by short-term minor weight increases or digestive discomfort.
    *   **Interest Development**: **The emerging photography hobby served as an unexpected "stress buffer"**. During high-stress work weeks (e.g., Sep 18), discovering and sharing industrial beauty brought pure mental satisfaction and positive feedback, effectively enhancing psychological resilience.

**Module 5: Anomaly Event Summary**
*   **Health Metric Anomaly Event**:
    *   **Event**: Stress-induced difficulty falling asleep.
    *   **Time**: September 23 to 25.
    *   **Impact**: Led to three consecutive days of severely insufficient sleep (<6 hours), daytime fatigue, decreased attention.
    *   **Recovery Status**: Starting Sep 24, you actively took stress-reduction measures (nap, deep breathing, declined late-night snacks, foot soak, early sleep). By Sep 26, sleep issue largely resolved, mental state recovered.
*   **Exercise Break Event**:
    *   **Event**: Dedicated exercise plan break.
    *   **Time**: September 19 to 24 (6 days total).
    *   **Cause**: Old residential area retrofit project crunch, work physical/mental exertion reached peak, chose to rest voluntarily to ensure work safety.
    *   **Recovery Performance**: Attempted to resume
