    *   Average Daily Non-exercise Steps: ~4500 steps (primary commute by e-bike, 10 min one-way, steps mainly from work site activity). Highest weekly steps in Week 3 (involved in mall wiring project), lowest in latter half of Week 4 (primarily desk work).
    *   Business Travel/Trips: No long-distance travel. However, participation in local emergency repair project from 24th-26th changed work location, increased average daily work hours by 2, leading to exercise pause and compressed sleep.
*   **Daily Life**:
    *   Screen Time: Daily average ~3.5 hours (work-related 1.5h, entertainment/social 2h). Highest days exceeded 5 hours (10th, 15th, due to forum sharing, research/planning).

**Monthly Trend Analysis**

**3.1 Activity Trends**
*   **Weekly Activity Volume Changes**:
    *   Week 1: 4 sessions, 18km running, early-month breakthrough & training period.
    *   Week 2: 4 sessions, 11km running, adjusted to recovery & taper due to exam prep/medical check, volume down ~25% week-over-week.
    *   Week 3: 6 sessions, 22km running (includes 10K race), activity peak, up 100% week-over-week.
    *   Week 4: 5 sessions, 5km running, focused on post-race recovery, core training & family activities, volume down 55% week-over-week.
*   **Training Cycle Peaks/Valleys**:
    *   Peak Week: Week 3, completed 10K race, peak performance and sense of achievement.
    *   Valley Week: Latter half of Week 4 (24th-26th), complete activity break due to emergency work project.
*   **Performance Changes**:
    *   Running pace showed a "breakthrough-adjustment-race-recovery" cycle. Week 1 fastest pace (5'45''), Week 2 intentionally slower (around 6'30''), Week 3 stable race pace (6'12''), Week 4 recovery easy runs.

**3.2 Health Trends**
*   **Sleep Trends**:
    *   Weeks 1 & 3 had relatively stable sleep duration and quality. Week 2 saw average sleep duration decrease ~0.5h and deep sleep percentage drop due to medical check anxiety (8th) and exam prep. Week 4 sleep continuity affected by delayed routine due to work project (24th-26th).
*   **Physical Health Trends**:
    *   Weekly average weight showed continuous decline, slight rebound in Week 2 due to social gatherings (5th, 6th), most noticeable control effect in Week 4.
    *   Resting Heart Rate and HRV showed an inverse relationship: when HRV rose (e.g., 7th, 31st), RHR lowered; during high work stress (12th, 18th), HRV lowered, RHR rose.
*   **Mental Health Trends**:
    *   Stress scores formed two minor peaks in Week 2 (exam, medical check) and Week 4 (work decisions, insurance signing). Weeks 1 & 3 with higher activity frequency had lower average stress.
    *   Emotional state highly positively correlated with achievement events (passing exam, recognition, family joy), effectively countering negative impacts of work stress.
*   **Injury Impact**: Minor ankle sprain on Dec 3 did not affect subsequent running plans but prompted greater emphasis on warm-up for squash. Minor finger cut on Dec 9, no impact on daily activities or work.

**3.3 Life Rhythm Trends**
*   **Routine & Mental State**: Data shows that on days following bedtime later than 23:30, self-reported mental state scores decreased by an average of 1.5 points, and willingness to engage in high-intensity exercise that day decreased by 70%.
*   **Work/Life Rhythm Changes**: Sharp increase in work intensity during Week 4 (24th-26th) directly led to cancelled exercise plans, reduced sleep by ~1 hour/day, increased eating out. Life changes like purchasing insurance (30th) brought increased psychological security, reflected in rising end-of-month health score.

**Personalized Insights**

*   **Sleep ↔ Performance**: Data indicates that when your estimated deep sleep duration is ≥1.5 hours (>22%), your average running pace the next day is 10-15 seconds/km faster compared to days with insufficient deep sleep, with lower perceived exertion. However, it was also observed that on the night after completing the 10K race (17th), deep sleep percentage slightly decreased, suggesting a need for more proactive relaxation and recovery measures on days following high-intensity exercise.
*   **Work Stress ↔ Health**: This month's case clearly shows that urgent work tasks (12th repair, 18th emotional fluctuation, 24th-26th project) are the core source of sudden stress spikes. Data shows that when the daily stress peak is ≥7/10, sleep efficiency that night decreases by ~15%, and next morning's resting heart rate increases by an average of 5 bpm. However, you effectively brought stress levels back to baseline within 1-2 days through social support like evening family conversation (23rd) and weekend family activities (21st).
*   **Activity Type ↔ Physical State**: Comparative analysis finds running is your core activity for improving cardiovascular fitness and achieving weight loss goals; weekly running distance is negatively correlated with weekly weight change. Squash and core training positively contribute to preventing work-related strain; during periods with shoulder/back stretching (3rd) and regular core training (after 19th), you reported no occupational muscle soreness. Different activity types form your comprehensive physical maintenance system.
*   **Behavioral Habits ↔ Overall Health**: Your health improvement this month benefited from two key behavioral changes: 1) **Dietary Control**: After clarifying dietary adjustments on Dec 15, the rate of weight loss increased, averaging 0.3kg/week, with a feeling of "digestive comfort". 2) **Routine Planning**: Despite 7 days of disruption, you consciously planned earlier bedtimes after high-intensity workdays (e.g., 22nd, 26th). This "compensatory" recovery prevented your health score from remaining persistently low. Data shows that when screen time for entertainment is controlled within 2 hours, your sleep onset latency significantly shortens.

**Abnormal Event Summary**

*   **Injury Events**:
    *   Dec 3: Minor right ankle sprain during squash match. Impact: Paused match for several minutes before continuing. Recovery: No hindrance to activities that day, no impact on subsequent exercise or work.
