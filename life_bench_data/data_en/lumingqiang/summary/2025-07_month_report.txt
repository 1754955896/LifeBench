Weekly averages roughly: Week 1 70.6kg, Week 2 70.9kg, Week 3 71.1kg, Week 4 70.4kg. **Maximum Fluctuation:** Reached 71.5kg on July 19th (rich diet on family day), dropped to 69.8kg on July 31st. Overall trend: "mid-month plateau/slight rise, late-month continuous decline."
    *   **Body Fat Percentage (Estimated):** Considering weight loss and increased exercise, estimated body fat percentage decreased slightly from ~22.5% at month start to ~22.0% at month end.
    *   **Resting Heart Rate (Estimated):** As a healthy male engaged in long-term physical labor and regular exercise, your estimated resting heart rate remains low, daily average ~55-60 bpm. May have briefly increased during heightened work pressure on July 8-9.
    *   **HRV (Estimated):** Overall should be in a good range. May have increased on days with sufficient post-exercise recovery (e.g., July 15th, 27th) and family leisure days (e.g., July 19th); may have temporarily decreased on days with overnight emergency repair (July 8th) and decision-making pressure (July 24th).

Diet structure primarily local home-style dishes (Hainanese chicken rice, etc.), balanced protein and carb intake. **Low frequency of takeout (estimated <5 times), homemade meals dominant.** More gatherings this month (4 times), impacting short-term weight fluctuations. Adequate daily water intake, often brewed barley water in late month for heat relief.

**Module 3: Monthly Trend Analysis**
**3.1 Exercise Trends**
*   **Weekly Exercise Volume Changes:**
    *   **Week 1 (1-7):** 3 sessions (swimming, squash, core training each 1), steady start.
    *   **Week 2 (8-14):** 2 sessions (squash, running each 1), exercise volume decreased 33% week-over-week, **primarily affected by emergency repair overtime on July 8th and subsequent work pressure, leading to reduced exercise frequency.**
    *   **Week 3 (15-21):** 4 sessions (swimming, squash, core training x2), increased 100% week-over-week. **Core training plan officially launched and executed twice, improving exercise systematization.**
    *   **Week 4 (22-31):** 5 sessions (squash, core training x3, end-of-month training), increased 25% week-over-week. **Core training frequency consolidated to 2-3 times per week, exercise habits further strengthened.**
*   **Training Cycle Peaks/Valleys:**
    *   **Peak Week:** Week 4. Highest number of sessions, good squash form (July 30th), core training became habitual, exercise performance and consistency reached monthly peak.
    *   **Valley Week:** Week 2. Lowest exercise frequency, primarily due to external work emergencies squeezing exercise time.
*   **Exercise Performance Changes:** **Squash performance showed a "V" trend:** Slightly fluctuated in Week 2 due to work pressure (July 9th), gradually recovered in Week 3 with core training initiation (July 16th focused on technique), reaching good form by Week 4 (July 23rd, 30th). **This demonstrates the positive supporting role of core training for your specific sport performance.**

**3.2 Health Trends**
*   **Sleep Trends:** Overall stable sleep duration. **Week 2:** Due to overnight repair on July 8th, average weekly sleep duration may have slightly decreased; **Week 4:** Late month bedtime slightly delayed due to exam planning, etc., but compensated on weekends, overall impact manageable.
*   **Physical Health Trends:**
    *   **Weight:** Weeks 1-3 fluctuated narrowly within 70.5-71.5kg range, noticeably affected by gatherings. **Week 4 (from 22nd) entered a significant downward channel, continuously dropping from 71.0kg to 69.8kg**, synchronized with increased core training, dietary attention, and post-project stress relief.
    *   **Resting Heart Rate & HRV (Estimated):** Trends negatively correlated with stressful events. During high-stress periods in Weeks 2 & 3, estimated resting heart rate slightly increased, HRV slightly decreased; in Week 4, with decisions made and exercise regularized, estimated resting heart rate returned to low levels, HRV improved.
*   **Mental Health Trends:** **Stress levels highly synchronized with major decision points.** July 8-9 and 22-24 were clear stress peaks. Mood states showed positive peaks after family activities (12th, 19th), post-exercise (20th, 23rd, 30th), and completing specific tasks (15th, 31st). **Data shows regular exercise (especially squash) is an effective stress buffer for you.**
*   **Injury Impact:** **Felt lower back soreness during squash on July 16th**, a warning signal. You immediately adjusted exercise intensity and more systematically executed core training. This event did not cause exercise pause but **prompted a shift in health management focus from "treatment" to "prevention"**. Subsequent core training execution effectively prevented further injury development.

**3.3 Life Rhythm Trends**
*   **Schedule & Mental State:** 8 days this month with bedtime after 23:30, mostly followed by workdays. Combined with event descriptions, on these days, although you could complete work, **daytime focus and learning efficiency may have been slightly affected (e.g., average learning efficiency on July 3rd), requiring reactivation through naps or evening exercise.**
*   **Work/Life Rhythm Changes:**
    *   **Work Intensity Changes:** High work intensity in Weeks 2 & 3 (power supply project, emergency repairs) and late Week 4 (distribution room renovation) directly led to compressed exercise time and delayed evening rest.
    *   **Life Change Impact:** Multiple family gatherings (5th, 11th, 13th) brought positive emotional value but were accompanied by increased food intake and minor schedule adjustments, the main cause of short-term weight fluctuations. You quickly adjusted by resuming regular diet and exercise.

**Module 4: Personalized Insights**
*   **Sleep ↔ Exercise Performance:** Your data shows that **after ensuring 7+ hours of sleep (as on most workdays), self-reported "sense of form" and "engagement" during next-day squash or swimming sessions were better** (e.g., July 15th, 23rd). Conversely, on days with insufficient sleep (e.g., July 9th), you proactively reduced exercise intensity, focusing more on stretching and technique practice.
*   **Work Pressure/Decisions ↔ Health:** This month's stress mainly stemmed from sudden work burdens and major career decisions. **Data shows high-pressure work weeks (e.g., Week 2) led to ~30% reduction in exercise frequency and may be accompanied by weight plateau or slight increase.** However, you effectively blocked the long-term negative impact of stress on health through **open communication with family (July 22nd), consulting mentors/friends (July 17th, 24th), and adhering to core exercise routines**. By month-end, both weight and health behaviors showed positive trends.
*   **Exercise Type ↔ Physical State:** **The introduction of core training was this month's key turning point.** Since systematic learning on July 20th, you executed it 2-3 times weekly. Data shows that **in squash sessions following core training (e.g., July 23rd), you self-reported feeling "more stable footwork" and "reduced lower back burden," with improved performance and confidence.** This validates the protective role of targeted strength training for your physically demanding job and high-impact sport.
*   **Behavioral Habits ↔ Overall Health:** **Your pragmatic personality (ISTJ) is a significant advantage for health management.** The decision to "shelve business venture and focus on certification" (July 24th), though based on rational analysis, objectively reduced uncertainty-related stress, allowing you to more systematically plan exam prep and health (e.g., detailed plan on July 31st). **Practical financial behaviors like monthly family income/expense review (July 15th, 31st) and purchasing supplementary medical insurance (July 25th) enhanced family security and psychological stability, indirectly supporting sustainable health status.**
