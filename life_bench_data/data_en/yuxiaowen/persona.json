        "relation_description": "Zhao Xiulan is a long-time close friend of Yu Xiaowen's mother, having been colleagues when they were young. Yu Xiaowen has addressed her as \"Aunt Zhao\" since childhood. Aunt Zhao has witnessed Xiaowen's growth—from her elementary school days in Luoyang, to studying at a university in another province, and eventually returning to work in Zhengzhou. Whenever Xiaowen visits her parents in her hometown of Luoyang, she makes it a point to stop by Aunt Zhao's home if time permits, catching up on each other's lives. Aunt Zhao is warm-hearted and always shows concern for Xiaowen's career and personal life, often bringing her homemade Luoyang specialties. Now living in Zhengzhou and Luoyang respectively, the two mainly stay in touch through WeChat video calls and phone conversations, with a frequency of about once or twice a month. During holidays, Xiaowen sends her blessings and greetings."
