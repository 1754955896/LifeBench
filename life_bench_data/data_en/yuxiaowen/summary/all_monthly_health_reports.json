Good activity diversity, but regularity impacted by work.\n*   **Health Status Summary**:\n    *   **Health Score**: Based on data inference, the monthly average health score is approximately 75/100. A good start (~80) at the beginning of the month (Jan 2) due to initiating regular exercise and data logging; score dropped to a low point (~65) mid-month (Week 3) due to work stress, night shifts, and a setback event; score recovered to ~80 by month-end through adjustment, family support, and holiday activities.\n    *   **Core Tags**: \"Resilient Adapter Under High-Pressure Rotation\", \"Flexible Activity Adjuster\", \"Family Support-Driven Health Restorer\".\n    *   **Overall Health Rating**: Good. Demonstrated the ability to maintain basic activity, proactively adjust, and seek balance under significant work pressure. Physiological indicators remained largely stable, and mental health effectively recovered after fluctuations.\n*   **Key Events**:\n    *   **Activity Milestones**: Initiated fitness tracker data logging and practiced regular exercise goals on the 2nd; Completed a family health hike, integrating activity and family bonding, on the 30th.\n    *   **Injury**: Minor right calf muscle strain during morning run on the 10th due to insufficient warm-up.\n    *   **Health Indicator Sudden Change**: Extreme physical and mental fatigue on the 21st due to participation in a critical rescue and night shift, causing a sharp drop in health score.\n    *   **Major Life Changes**: Started cardiology rotation on the 6th, leading to a significant increase in work intensity and pressure; Returned home for the Spring Festival holiday from the 28th to 31st, switching life rhythm to family reunion mode.\n*   **Goal Completion Status**:\n    *   **Set Goal**: \"At least three regular exercise sessions per week.\"\n    *   **Completion Rate**: 11 active days in total for the month, averaging ~2.75 sessions per week, achieving a **91.7%** goal completion rate. Failed to fully meet the weekly frequency of 3 times due to rotation work (especially night shifts) and an injury.\n    *   **Reasons for Non-Completion**: Primarily high work intensity in weeks 2 and 3 (e.g., night shifts on the 8th, 21st), and a 3-day activity hiatus due to the muscle strain on the 10th.\n*   **Core Changes vs. Last Month** (Inferred based on user profile that last month was a regular work period):\n    *   **Activity Volume**: Activity types became more diverse (added shooting, family hiking), but total activity sessions likely **decreased by ~15% month-over-month** due to the rotation. Activity pattern shifted from individual regular morning runs more towards flexible modes combined with social and family activities.\n    *   **Health Indicators**: Weight slightly increased from 50.0kg at month-start to 51.0kg at month-end (+1.0kg, +2.0%), mainly influenced by family diet during the Spring Festival holiday; Resting heart rate **increased by ~5-8 bpm month-over-month** during the mid-month high-stress period, recovering by month-end holiday.\n    *   **Life Rhythm**: Sleep schedule variability **significantly increased**, with bedtime fluctuating widely between 23:00-00:30 due to studying and night shifts, contrasting with the relatively regular schedule of the previous month. Work-related screen time increased.\n*   **Core Focus Areas**: High-frequency focus this month on \"**Balancing work stress and exercise performance**\", \"**Maintaining physical and mental health under high pressure**\", and \"**How to integrate healthy habits into an irregular work life**\".\n\n**Monthly Review**\n\n**2.1 Activity Review**\n*   **Activity Overview**:\n    *   Engaged in 6 types of activities throughout the month: running, badminton, family hiking, yoga/stretching, shooting, pottery.\n    *   Activity session distribution: Running 36.4%, Low-intensity activities (Shooting/Pottery) 27.3%, Yoga/Stretching 18.2%, Badminton 9.1%, Family Hiking 9.1%.\n    *   **Activity Intensity Distribution**: Z2 Moderate Intensity (running, badminton, hiking) total duration ~417 minutes, accounting for 64.5%; Z1 Low Intensity (yoga, stretching, walking commute) total duration ~230 minutes, accounting for 35.5%; No Z3 High-Intensity training recorded.\n*   **Activity Statistics & Best Performances**:\n    *   **Running**: Total distance 20 km, average pace ~6'25\"/km.

Weekly averages: Week 1 50.1kg, Week 2 50.1kg, Week 3 50.3kg, Week 4 50.8kg. **Largest fluctuation** occurred during month-end holiday (28th-31st), cumulative increase of 1.0kg, primarily due to family diet. Overall slight upward trend by month-end due to holiday.\n    *   **Body Fat Percentage (Estimate)**: Based on weight and activity changes, remained stable throughout the month, fluctuation less than 0.5%.\n    *   **Resting Heart Rate**: Daily average ~62 bpm. Lowest ~58 bpm (4th, good rest); Highest ~70 bpm (21st, after rescue and night shift). Overall trend highly synchronized with stress cycles.\n    *   **HRV (Heart Rate Variability, Estimate)**: Daily average at medium level. Weekly averages show HRV decreased ~10-15% during high-pressure work weeks 2 & 3, rebounded in Week 4 holiday and likely exceeded initial levels.\n*   **Mental Health**:\n    *   **Stress**: Daily average stress level ~5/10. Weekly averages: Week 1 4/10, Weeks 2 & 3 rose to 6.5/10, Week 4 dropped to 3/10. **High-Stress Period**: 15th-23rd, stress levels reached 7-8/10, sources being \"challenges in managing critically ill patients\", \"night shift fatigue\", and \"short-term self-blame regarding professional competence\".\n    *   **Mood**: Predominant mood tags were \"focused\", \"fulfilled\", \"calm\", interspersed with \"anxious\" (3rd, 20th-21st), \"excited\" (6th, 18th), \"exhausted\" (8th, 21st), and \"joyful/satisfied\" (24th, 30th). Mood fluctuations directly correlated with work events, social activities, and family reunions.\n    *   **Health Score (Inferred)**: Daily average ~75. Highest score ~85 (2nd, 30th), due to initiating activity and family activities; Lowest score ~65 (21st), due to work setback and extreme fatigue.\n\n**2.3 Life Rhythm Review**\n*   **Sleep/Wake Habits**:\n    *   **Average Daily Schedule**: Workdays average bedtime ~23:40, wake-up ~06:45; Weekends/Holidays average bedtime ~23:00, wake-up ~08:15.\n    *   **Difference**: Weekend wake-up ~90 minutes later than workdays, total sleep duration ~1.5 hours longer.\n    *   **Disrupted Days**: Days with bedtime later than 23:30 totaled 14 days, with 8 days later than 00:00, primarily due to \"overtime/night shifts\" (5 days), \"studying/reading\" (6 days), and \"social activities\" (3 days).\n*   **Commute / Activity**:\n    *   **Non-Exercise Steps**: Daily average ~8000 steps (estimated based on physician profession). Highest weekly steps expected in Week 3 (busy work), lowest in Week 4 holiday.\n    *   **Commute**: Mode: walking or driving, one-way distance ~3 km, average daily round-trip commute duration ~20 minutes.\n    *   **Business Trip/Travel**: 1 trip, Spring Festival return home (Luoyang) from 28th-31st. Impact: Activity mode shifted from individual morning runs to family hiking, sleep duration increased, dietary caloric intake increased.\n*   **Daily Life**:\n    *   **Screen Time**: Total daily average ~9 hours, of which work-related (medical records, studying) ~6 hours, entertainment/social ~3 hours. Highest daily duration exceeded 11 hours (20th, 27th, due to late-night studying).\n    *   **Dietary Habits**: High regularity of three meals, ~25 days regular. Balanced diet structure, preference for high-protein (fruit salad) and local carbs (braised noodles, spicy soup). Approx. 10 meals from takeout/dining out, ~21 homemade meals for the month. Estimated daily water intake ~1.8L.\n\n**Monthly Trend Analysis**\n\n**3.1 Activity Trends**\n*   **Weekly Activity Volume Changes**:\n    *   **Week 1 (1st-5th)**: Total activity 2 sessions (running 1, walking 1), duration ~92 minutes. Recovery period post-New Year holiday.\n    *   **Week 2 (6th-12th)**: Total activity 3 sessions (running 1 leading to strain, pottery 1, walking 1), duration ~180 minutes. **Activity volume increased 96% month-over-month**, but types shifted to low-intensity due to faster work pace after rotation start.\n    *   **Week 3 (13th-19th)**: Total activity 3 sessions (shooting 2, badminton 1), duration ~300 minutes. **Activity volume increased 67% month-over-month**, primarily social stress-relief activities, corresponding to high work pressure period.\n    *   **Week 4 (20th-26th & 28th-31st)**: Total activity 3 sessions (yoga 1, running 1, family hiking 1), duration ~215 minutes. Activity volume **decreased 28% month-over-month**, initially due to adjustment after work setback, later shifting to holiday family activity mode.\n*   **Training Cycle Peaks/Lows**:\n    *   **Performance Peak Week**: Week 3. Despite high stress, effectively released pressure through social activities like shooting and badminton, showing high activity willingness and motivation.\n    *   **Performance Low Week**: Early Week 4 (20th-23rd). Affected by the 21st event, activity adjusted to lowest-intensity recovery yoga, representing a low point in psychology and physical energy.\n*   **Activity Performance Changes**: Limited running performance data, but shows stable pace from month-start (2nd, pace 6'28\") to month-end (25th, estimated similar pace) despite experiencing work stress cycles, reflecting a good aerobic capacity base.\n\n**3.2 Health Trends**\n*   **Sleep Trends**: Sleep duration stable in Weeks 1 & 2 (~7 hours); Compressed to ~6 hours in Week 3, with decreased deep sleep percentage; Recovered to over 8 hours with improved quality in Week 4 holiday. Sleep continuity was poorest in Week 3.\n*   **Physical Health Trends**: Weight remained extremely stable for the first three weeks (narrow fluctuation 50.0-50.5kg), linearly increased in Week 4 holiday. Resting heart rate and HRV showed an inverse relationship: both increased resting heart rate and decreased HRV in Weeks 2 & 3; both improved in Week 4. **Indicator Sudden Change Node**: 21st, estimated peak resting heart rate and lowest HRV for the month, directly triggered by work stress event.\n*   **Mental Health Trends**: Stress levels began climbing in Week 2, peaked in Week 3, and dropped sharply in Week 4. Mood fluctuated with the stress curve but recovered quickly in late Week 3 (after 23rd) through proactive communication, cultural activities, and family support. Data indicates **activity, especially social activity (Week 3), had a buffering effect on mood during high-pressure periods**.\n*   **Injury Impact**: Calf strain on the 10th led to interruption of running plans from 10th-12th, prompting a shift in activity types to low-intensity activities like pottery. No significant impact on core physiological indicators, shooting experience resumed on the 13th.\n\n**3.3 Life Rhythm Trends**\n*   **Sleep Schedule & Mental State**: Data shows that **on days following bedtime later than 23:30, self-reported mental state descriptions were mostly \"tired\", \"slightly anxious\", and the daily activity plan was more likely to be canceled or downgraded** (e.g., 22nd).\n*   **Work/Life Rhythm Changes**: Weeks 2-3 were the peak work intensity period, accompanied by night shifts and rescue events, directly leading to activity hiatuses, reduced sleep, and sudden stress spikes. Week 4 holiday life rhythm completely changed, focusing on family, socializing, and leisure, with comprehensive rebound in all health indicators.\n\n**Personalized Insights**\n\n*   **Sleep ↔ Activity Performance**: Data shows that **when sleep duration ≥7.5 hours (e.g., holidays), willingness and execution rate for activity the next day increased by 50%**. Conversely, after workdays with insufficient sleep (<6.5 hours) and high pressure, the probability of engaging in moderate or higher intensity activity (e.g., running) was extremely low, with a tendency to choose yoga or complete rest.\n*   **Travel/Pressure ↔ Health**: **During the Spring Festival return home (similar to short business trip), average daily sleep duration increased by 1.5 hours, stress level decreased by 4 points (on a 10-point scale), but average daily non-exercise energy expenditure decreased, and weight showed a linear increase of 0.2kg per day**. During high work pressure periods (stress level ≥7/10), resting heart rate increased by 8-10 bpm, and HRV decreased by 15%-20%.\n*   **Activity Type ↔ Physical State**: Comparisons show that **during high-pressure work weeks (e.g., Week 3), group or social activities (badminton, shooting) improved daily mood scores more than individual running alone, and had a better mitigating effect on subsequent sleep anxiety**. **Performing yoga or stretching at least once a week helped alleviate muscle stiffness caused by prolonged standing and work tension, and psychologically established a positive \"active recovery\" mindset**.\n*   **Behavioral Habits ↔ Overall Health**: **The stability of \"bedtime\" had a more significant impact on next-day mental state than \"total sleep duration\"**. Periods with large bedtime fluctuations this month generally had lower health scores. **When the proportion of homemade meals exceeded 70% (this month ~21 days), even with increased dining out (Spring Festival), weight gain trend was relatively moderate (total +1kg for the month, mainly concentrated in the last 4 days)**. Screen time, especially work/study-related screen use within 1 hour before bed, was positively correlated with sleep onset delay, averaging ~25 minutes delay per night.\n\n**Abnormal Event Summary**\n\n*   **Injury Event**:\n    *   **Event**: Minor right calf muscle strain.\n    *   **Time**: Morning of January 10th.\n    *   **Impact**: Led to cancellation of planned morning run, paused running from 10th-12th, adjusted activity to walking and pottery (non-impact activities).\n    *   **Recovery**: Resumed low-intensity shooting on the 13th without reported discomfort; resumed morning run on the 25th, indicating full recovery.\n*   **Activity Hiatus Event**:\n    *   **Event**: Activity hiatus due to work intensity and mental fatigue.\n    *   **Time**: January 20th-22nd,",
  "2025-02": "Your Monthly Summary is as follows:\n\n**Monthly Overview**\n\n*   **Basic Information**: Yu Xiaowen, 24 years old, female, Occupation: Resident Physician (Healthcare Industry).\n*   **Total Physical Activity**:\n    *   Running: 2 sessions / Total 40 minutes / 5.0 km\n    *   Badminton: 1 session / 90 minutes\n    *   City Walk: 3 sessions / Total approx. 60 minutes / Estimated 6.4 km\n    *   Indoor Light Activity (Stretching, etc.): 2 sessions / Total approx. 30 minutes\n    *   **Monthly Total**: 8 activity sessions / Total approx. 220 minutes (3.7 hours). Activity volume decreased significantly due to illness mid-month, characterized by a \"restart-interruption-cautious recovery\" pattern.\n*   **Health Status Summary**:\n    *   **Core Tag**: \"Cautious Recovery and Systemic Adjustment Following Major Illness Interruption\". Experienced an immune system breakdown (flu) due to high-intensity work, leading to deep reflection on self-health management as a doctor. Shifted towards building a systematic health management system (sleep schedule, work methods, health records) by month-end.\n    *   **Overall Health Rating**: **Good**. Despite a mid-month health crisis, recovery was rapid, and the crisis was transformed into motivation for deepening health management. Both physiological and psychological states returned to good levels by month-end.\n*   **Key Events**:\n    *   **Activity Milestone**: On the 22nd, cautiously resumed running post-illness, marking a shift in exercise focus from pursuing metrics to paying attention to bodily feedback.\n    *   **Injury/Illness**: On the 9th-12th, contracted the flu (high fever, fatigue) due to decreased immunity after a continuous 36-hour shift, leading to complete rest.\n    *   **Health Metric Fluctuation**: On the 9th-11th, weight dropped from 49.6kg to the month's low of 49.2kg, caused by illness-related depletion and loss of appetite.\n    *   **Major Life Change**: On the 2nd, began rotation in the Cardiovascular Department, entering a new phase of work pace and pressure patterns.\n*   **Goal Completion Status**:\n    *   **Set Goal**: \"Restart and maintain the morning running habit\".\n    *   **Completion Rate**: **Approximately 50%**.

Overall execution was disrupted by unexpected events.\n    *   **Reasons for Incompletion**: Direct cause was falling ill after consecutive high-intensity shifts on Feb 8th-9th. Core reason was an imbalance between work intensity and personal recovery capacity.\n*   **Core Changes vs. Last Month (Inferred from lifestyle descriptions)**:\n    *   **Activity Volume**: **Significant month-on-month decrease**. Due to the end of the Spring Festival holiday, pressure from the new rotation department, and mid-month illness, both frequency and intensity of activity were lower than during the regular period of the previous month.\n    *   **Health Metrics**: **Increased weight fluctuation**. This month's weight fluctuation range reached 1.0kg (49.2-50.2kg), significantly higher than usual, primarily influenced by illness.\n    *   **Life Rhythm**: **Prominent work pressure peaks, shifting towards active management later**. High-pressure periods occurred at the start of the rotation and during end-of-month shifts. However, by month-end, began building a stress-resistant rhythm by introducing the Pomodoro Technique and adjusting sleep schedule.\n*   **Core Focus Areas**: This month's high-frequency focuses were \"persistence and interruption of exercise habits\", \"sleep schedule adjustment\", and \"health maintenance under work pressure\".\n\n**Monthly Review**\n\n**2.1 Activity Review**\n*   **Activity Overview**:\n    *   Engaged in 4 types of activity throughout the month: Running (2 sessions, 25%), Badminton (1 session, 12.5%), City Walk (3 sessions, 37.5%), Indoor Light Activity (2 sessions, 25%).\n    *   **Activity Intensity Distribution**: Primarily Z2 moderate intensity (e.g., badminton, recovery runs), approx. 60%; supplemented by Z1 low intensity (e.g., City Walk, stretching), approx. 40%; no Z3 high-intensity training.\n*   **Activity Statistics & Best Performances**:\n    *   **Running**: Total distance 5.0 km, average pace approx. 8'00\"/km (post-illness recovery runs were very slow).

Sleep interruptions were frequent during illness.\n*   **Physiological Health Trends**:\n    *   **Weight & Body Fat**: Rapid decrease in Week 2, slow recovery in Weeks 3-4, forming a \"V-shaped\" curve, completely aligning with the illness cycle.\n    *   **Resting Heart Rate & HRV**: Increased resting heart rate and decreased HRV in Week 2, indicating high stress and inflammatory state; both metrics returned to baseline in Week 4, indicating good recovery. Data shows HRV recovery slightly lagged behind perceived recovery.\n*   **Mental Health Trends**: Stress levels and emotional state closely followed work events and physical health. Stress peak and negative emotions coexisted in Week 2; through socializing (23rd), team activities (28th), and self-regulation in Week 4, stress was effectively alleviated, and mood shifted positively.\n*   **Illness Impact**: The flu (9th-12th) caused **complete activity interruption for 12 days**, **weight loss of 1.0kg**, **increase in resting heart rate by approx. 10 bpm**, and induced feelings of \"vulnerability and guilt\". Not until Week 4 did activity capacity cautiously recover to about 70% of pre-illness level.\n\n**3.3 Life Rhythm Trends**\n*   **Sleep Schedule & Mental State**: Data shows that on days following bedtime after 24:00, self-reported \"fatigue\" increased and subjective work efficiency ratings decreased. After implementing a fixed sleep schedule at month-end, daytime mental state became more stable.\n*   **Work/Life Rhythm Changes**: The \"36-hour shift\" in Week 2 was the health turning point this month, directly triggering a chain reaction. The trial of the \"Pomodoro Technique\" starting in Week 4 was a behavioral correction to this event, aiming to segment prolonged mental labor to protect focus and energy.\n\n**Personalized Insights**\n\n*   **Sleep ↔ Activity Performance**: Your data shows that **when sleep duration is ≥7.5 hours and bedtime is stable, the willingness and completion rate of activity the next day are higher**. For example, sufficient sleep the night before the 22nd's run restart. Inverse correlation: After the severely insufficient sleep following the ultra-long shift on the 8th, not only was there no activity, but it directly triggered illness.\n*   **Work Pressure/Events ↔ Health**: **Extreme work events (consecutive shifts) have a devastating impact on health**. Data shows that after the shifts on the 8th-9th, it directly led to immune system collapse (flu) and worsened multiple physiological metrics like weight, heart rate, and HRV. A stress peak (≥7/10) lasting over 48 hours is a clear health risk signal.\n*   **Activity Type ↔ Physical State**: Comparison reveals that **activities with a social component like badminton have a significant immediate improvement effect on your mental health** (stress level dropped from 5.0 to 4.5 after the 23rd). Conversely, **very low-intensity running post-illness (focusing on feedback rather than data) was key to safely restarting activity**, avoiding secondary injury.\n*   **Behavioral Habits ↔ Overall Health**: **Establishing systematic management habits (e.g., health records, sleep schedule) brings a sense of control, directly improving mental health scores**. After initiating health record organization and sleep planning at month-end, the emotion tag \"anxious\" decreased while \"grounded\" increased. **Periods with a higher proportion of homemade meals (e.g., Week 4) saw more stable weight recovery**.\n\n**Abnormal Event Summary**\n\n1.  **Illness Event**:\n    *   **Event**: Acute upper respiratory infection (flu).\n    *   **Time**: Feb 9th (high fever) to Feb 12th (main symptoms alleviated).\n    *   **Impact**: Directly caused complete interruption of activity plan (10th-21st); weight loss of 1.0kg; increased resting heart rate; induced significant mental fatigue and loneliness.\n    *   **Recovery**: Entered recovery period from Feb 13th, cautiously restarted activity on the 22nd. By month-end, physiological metrics largely recovered, but activity performance not yet at pre-illness level, recovery rate approx. 80%.\n2.  **Activity Break Event**:\n    *   **Event**: Prolonged activity break due to illness.\n    *   **Time Period**: Feb 10th to Feb 21st, totaling 12 days.\n    *   **Cause**: Directly caused by the flu triggered by consecutive 36-hour high-intensity shifts on the 8th-9th.\n    *   **Post-Break Recovery Performance**: First recovery run on the 22nd, adopted very low intensity (2 km, slow pace). Bodily feedback was good, no discomfort, but cardiovascular system felt more strained than pre-illness.\n3.  **Health Metric Fluctuation Event**:\n    *   **Event**: Significant short-term weight loss.\n    *   **Metric & Time**: Weight, between Feb 9th and 11th, dropped sharply from 49.6kg to 49.2kg.\n    *   **Fluctuation Magnitude**: 0.4kg drop over 3 days, cumulative 1.0kg drop from pre-illness.\n    *   **Cause**: High fever consumption, loss of appetite, and insufficient intake due to flu.\n    *   **Subsequent Change**: From the 12th onwards, with disease improvement and nutritional supplementation, weight entered a recovery phase, returning to 50.0kg by the 28th.\n4.  **Life Rhythm Anomaly Event**:\n    *   **Event**: Ultra-long consecutive shift and emergency overtime.\n    *   **Anomaly Period**: Feb 8th morning to Feb 9th morning (continuous 36 hours); also multiple days of overtime past 23:00 due to emergencies/consultations.\n    *   **Impact**: The direct trigger for this month's health crisis, causing acute sleep deprivation, extreme fatigue, ultimately breaching immune defenses.\n    *   **Recovery Measures & Effect**: After the event, you actively engaged in systematic reflection and introduced the \"Pomodoro Technique\" from the 25th, planned a fixed sleep schedule, attempting to build defenses from the",

Difference from goal: 0.5 sessions/week.\n    *   Reasons for Non-Completion: Primarily due to emotional fluctuations and energy dispersion following the housing crisis post-March 5th, resulting in several zero-activity days; secondary reason was the shoulder strain on March 30th prematurely ending that week's activity.\n*   **Core Changes vs. Last Month**:\n    *   **Activity Volume**: Inferred to show a downward trend month-over-month. Running frequency and pace were affected; mindfulness meditation was added as \"mental exercise\".\n    *   **Health Metrics**: Resting heart rate significantly increased (estimated from ~58 bpm to ~65 bpm mid-month); weight showed minor fluctuations (start: 50.0kg, end: 50.3kg); sleep duration and quality showed a significant decline mid-month.\n    *   **Life Rhythm**: Increased number of days with disrupted sleep schedule (~10 days sleeping after 23:30), increased screen time (especially evening browsing for rental information), life themes dominated by house-hunting, financial planning, etc.\n*   **Core Focus Areas**: This month, the user frequently focused on **stress management** (via meditation, music, socializing), **sleep improvement** (trying meditation for sleep), and maintaining **basic exercise habits** amidst fluctuations.\n\n**Monthly Review**\n\n**2.1 Activity Review**\n*   **Activity Overview**:\n    *   Activity Types & Proportions: Walking (40%), Running (30%), Badminton (15%), Other Light Activities (15%).\n    *   Intensity Distribution: Z1 Low Intensity (walking, meditation, organizing, ~55%), Z2 Moderate Intensity (jogging, regular badminton play, ~40%), Z3 High Intensity (badminton smashes, etc., ~5%). This month's activity was primarily maintenance-oriented at low to moderate intensity.\n*   **Activity Statistics & Best Performances**:\n    *   **Running**: Total distance ~21km, average pace ~6'20\"/km (pace decreased compared to usual due to stress), longest single distance 5km (March 2nd), fastest pace estimated at ~6'00\"/km based on good condition, average and max heart rates elevated during stress period.\n    *   **Badminton**: Total duration ~4.3 hours, longest single session 1.5 hours (March 19th), activity format was doubles practice, offering both social and stress-relief benefits.\n    *   **Walking/City Walk**: Total duration ~9.5 hours, longest single session 2 hours (March 23rd), combining exploration, socializing, and low-intensity aerobic function.\n*   **Activity Habit Preferences**:\n    *   High-Frequency Activity Days: Saturday, Sunday (each accounting for 30% of active days).\n    *   High-Frequency Activity Times: Morning (7:00-8:00, 30%, mainly morning runs), Evening (17:30-19:00, 50%, mainly post-work runs or badminton), Variable times (20%, e.g., weekend City Walks).\n    *   Activity Locations: Community/Park (running, walking), Badminton Court, City Streets (City Walk), Home (meditation).\n    *   Activity Consistency: Longest consecutive active days was 3 days (e.g., March 1-2). Main gaps occurred March 5-7 (3-day gap due to emotional low from sudden housing crisis) and March 17-18 (2-day gap due to work overtime and fatigue).\n\n**2.2 Health Review**\n*   **Sleep**:\n    *   Average Daily Sleep Duration: Workdays ~6.5 hours, Weekends ~7.5 hours. Overall insufficient sleep.\n    *   Sleep Stage Distribution (estimated): Deep Sleep ~1.6 hours (25%), Light Sleep ~3.4 hours (52%), REM ~1.5 hours (23%). Deep sleep proportion estimated to decrease during mid-month stress period.\n    *   Schedule Stability: Workday bedtime highly variable (22:40 to 01:10), wake-up time relatively stable (06:30-07:00); weekend schedule slightly later. Bedtime fluctuation range exceeded 2 hours.\n    *   Average Daily Sleep Interruptions: Estimated 2-3 times/night during mid-month anxiety period, improved to 0-1 times/night after meditation by month-end.\n*   **Physiological Metrics**:\n    *   Weight: Start 50.0kg, End 50.3kg, overall slight increase of 0.3kg. Weekly averages fluctuated between 49.2kg (reduced appetite during stress) and 50.3kg (after social meals), max fluctuation 1.1kg (March 15th 49.2kg vs March 9th 50.0kg). Trend was initial decrease followed by increase, correlating with stress and dietary changes.\n    *   Body Fat % (estimated): Remained stable or showed minor fluctuations based on weight and activity changes.\n    *   Resting Heart Rate: Daily average increased from ~58 bpm at month start to ~65 bpm during mid-month stress, recovering to ~62 bpm by month-end. Highest values occurred the week after the stressful event (estimated 65-68 bpm), lowest during stable period at month start (~57 bpm).\n    *   HRV (Heart Rate Variability, estimated): Trend opposite to resting heart rate, showing a decrease during mid-month stress, with some recovery by month-end alongside stress relief and meditation.\n*   **Mental Health**:\n    *   Stress: Daily stress levels showed a \"Medium-High-Easing\" trend. Stress rapidly increased to 8/10 (10-point scale) after March 5th, remaining high until late month; the week starting March 21st with meditation introduction saw average stress drop to 6/10. High-stress period was March 5-20, primarily sourced from housing crisis and associated work/life uncertainty.\n    *   Mood: Dominant mood tags alternated between \"Anxiety/Unease\" and \"Calm/Contentment\". Mood fluctuation periods: March 5-15 dominated by anxiety; feelings of calm and contentment appeared after March 14th (concert), March 23rd (City Walk), March 26th (organizing/farewell).\n    *   Health Score (estimated): Daily average score 6.8. Lowest scores (~5.0) occurred around March 6th and 13th (stress and poor sleep combined); highest scores (~7.5) occurred on March 14th (concert) and March 26th (after organizing completion). Score changes directly correlated with stressful events and effectiveness of coping measures.\n\n**2.3 Life Rhythm Review**\n*   **Sleep/Wake Habits**:\n    *   Average Daily Bedtime/Wake-up: Workdays bedtime ~23:50, wake-up ~06:50; Weekends bedtime ~23:40, wake-up ~07:40. Weekends: 10 minutes later to bed, 50 minutes later to rise, ~1 hour more total sleep.\n    *   Days with Disrupted Schedule: ~10 days in the month with bedtime after 23:30, mainly due to anxious thoughts about housing, overtime work, and pre-sleep screen use for information browsing.\n*   **Commute/Activity**:\n    *   Average Daily Non-Exercise Steps: ~4000 steps (inferred based on commuting by car and mostly indoor work activity). Lowest weekly step counts occurred during busy work weeks with no extra activity (e.g., week 3), highest during weekends with City Walks (e.g., week 4).\n    *   Commute: Method is driving, one-way distance ~5 km (from Jinshui District home to Zhongyuan District hospital), average daily round-trip commute duration ~20 minutes.\n    *   Business Travel/Vacation: None this month.\n*   **Daily Life**:\n    *   Screen Use: Average daily total duration ~5 hours, of which work-related (medical records system, study) ~3.5 hours, entertainment/information (rental apps, social media, reading) ~1.5 hours. Peak usage days occurred on weekends focused on house-hunting (over 3 hours entertainment screen time).\n    *   Eating Habits: Regular three meals on ~20 days (irregular days mainly due to overtime, anxiety causing missed meals or simple takeout). Dietary structure leans towards high-carb (favoring stewed noodles, spicy soup), but conscious effort made this month to increase fruit salads. Estimated takeout meals ~8 times, home-cooked meals ~22 times. Average daily water intake ~1.5L, basically meeting target.\n\n**Monthly Trend Analysis**\n\n**3.1 Activity Trends**\n*   **Weekly Activity Volume Changes**:\n    *   Week 1 (1st-7th): Moderate activity, but zero activity in last 3 days due to stressful event. Activity mainly running and badminton.\n    *   Week 2 (8th-14th): Activity volume recovered, tried shooting for stress relief, weekend City Walk. Activity types diversified.\n    *   Week 3 (15th-21st): Activity volume maintained, introduced evening walks with mindfulness, began regular meditation. Activity started serving stress management.\n    *   Week 4 (22nd-31st): Activity volume increased then decreased, early period saw increased walking from active house-viewing, late period affected by shoulder injury limiting badminton. Activity performance constrained by physical state.\n*   **Training Cycle Peaks/Lows**:\n    *   Performance Peak Week: Week 2. Despite stress, proactive intervention through shooting, concert, socializing provided emotional release, and activity participation recovered.\n    *   Performance Low Week: Latter half of Week 1 (March 5-7). Impacted by sudden event, activity completely halted, various health metrics began deteriorating.\n*   **Activity Performance Changes**:\n    *   Running pace noticeably decreased in the week following March 5th (~20 sec/km slower), stabilizing towards month-end with stress adaptation and meditation intervention, but not yet returned to pre-event levels. This demonstrates the immediate and sustained impact of psychological load on activity performance.\n\n**3.2 Health Trends**\n*   **Sleep Trends**:\n    *   Weeks 1-2: Sleep duration and stability rapidly deteriorated, deep sleep proportion estimated to decrease.\n    *   Weeks 3-4: With establishment of meditation habit (starting March 21st) and problem organization (e.g., March 26th organizing), sleep duration recovered somewhat, difficulty falling asleep slightly eased, but deep sleep recovery lagged behind total duration.\n*   **Physical Health Trends**:\n    *   Weight curve showed a \"V\" shape: Initial decrease due to reduced appetite under stress (lowest point 49.2kg in Week 2), later increase due to social meals and emotional eating (recovering to 50.3kg in Week 4).\n    *   Resting Heart Rate and HRV showed clear \"mirror\" changes: Post-March 5th, RHR climbed and HRV dropped, reaching a turning point around March 20th (active stress management), after which RHR slowly declined and HRV gradually recovered.\n*   **Mental Health Trends**:\n    *   Stress levels remained high throughout mid-to-late month, only showing a trend decline after initiating daily meditation on March 21st. Data indicates that active psychological interventions (meditation, deep socializing, artistic experiences) were key to the stress curve inflection point.\n    *   Correlation between activity frequency and mental state: During complete activity hiatus (March 5-7), anxiety was strongest; resuming activity (even just walking) significantly improved mood.\n*   **Injury Impact**: March 30th mild right shoulder strain directly affected badminton that day and potentially subsequent upper body strength training, prompting a shift in activity pattern towards gentler walking and meditation.\n\n**3.3 Life Rhythm Trends**\n*   **Sleep Schedule & Mental State**: Data shows that whenever bedtime was after 23:30, the probability of the user describing the next day as \"fatigued\" or \"slightly fatigued\" increased, and that day's activity plan was more likely to be cancelled (e.g., March 7th, 17th).\n*   **Work/Life Rhythm Changes**:\n    *   Work Intensity: Remained high throughout the month, with notable peaks on March 3rd (independent patient admission), March 5th (night shift emergency), March 17th (patient condition change), directly leading to cancellation or postponement of that day's activity.\n    *   Life Changes: The \"housing crisis\" initiated on March 5th was the core variable dominating this month's life rhythm, triggering a chain reaction from emotional anxiety to financial planning, from organizing belongings to social negotiation, systematically squeezing activity and rest time.\n\n**Personalized Insights**\n\n*   **Sleep ↔ Activity Performance**: Your data clearly shows that on days following insufficient sleep (especially with estimated deep sleep under 1.5 hours) or poor sleep quality, your evening running pace on average decreases by 15-25 seconds/km, and subjective fatigue is stronger. Conversely, after the March 14th concert which provided deep mental relaxation, although no activity was recorded the next day, the mental state was described as \"content\", storing energy for subsequent activities.\n*   **Stress ↔ Health**: The March 5th housing crisis, as an acute stressor, triggered a physiological stress response lasting several weeks. Data shows that during the peak stress period (March 5-15), your average resting heart rate increased by ~10%, sleep efficiency decreased, and activity performance was impaired. However, after maintaining daily meditation starting March 21st, despite the stressor persisting, resting heart rate began a declining trend, proving the effectiveness of active relaxation techniques in buffering the physiological stress response.\n*   **Activity Type ↔ Physical State**: Comparison reveals that during high-stress periods, group-based, socially-oriented activities (e.g., City Walk with close friend, badminton with colleagues) provided more significant mood enhancement effects than solo running. However, note that engaging in high-intensity, competitive sports (e.g., March 30th badminton) when physically and mentally exhausted increases injury risk. In the latter part of the month, low-intensity walking combined with mindful breathing became a more sustainable stress-management activity for you.\n*   **Behavioral Habits ↔ Overall Health**:\n    *   **Meditation Habit**: Data shows that since establishing a daily meditation habit on March 21st, your evening sleep latency improved and sleep interruptions decreased. This is the most important positive behavioral change this month.\n    *   **Social Support**: Deep conversations with parents (March 25th) and close friend (multiple times) were clearly recorded as key moments for mood \"relief\", \"warmth\", \"peace of mind\". Strong social support served as a buffer in your crisis response.\n    *   **Screen Use**: Evening pre-sleep browsing of rental apps and financial information directly correlated with \"racing thoughts\" and \"delayed sleep onset\", constituting a negative factor for sleep hygiene this month.\n\n**Abnormal Event Summary**\n\n1.  **Major Life Stress Event**:\n    *   **Occurrence Time**: March 5th.\n    *   **Event Type**: Received landlord's notice to sell property, triggering a housing crisis.\n    *   **Impact Scope**: Caused a complete 3-day activity hiatus; triggered weeks of anxiety, leading to increased resting heart rate, decreased sleep quality, and activity performance fluctuations; initiated a series of life tasks like house-hunting, financial planning, and organizing belongings.\n    *   **Recovery Status**: Through active coping (establishing emergency fund, meditation, seeking social support, organizing belongings for psychological closure), mood stabilized towards month-end, physiological metrics (resting heart rate) partially recovered. However, the life issue remains unresolved, continuing as background stress.\n2.  **Activity Injury Event**:\n    *   **Occurrence Time**: March 30th evening.\n    *   **Injury Type**: Mild right shoulder muscle strain.\n    *   **Impact Scope**: Caused cessation of badminton activity that day and affected ability for subsequent days' vigorous upper-body activities.\n    *   **Recovery Status**: Immediately stopped the movement causing injury, subsequent activity adjusted to low-intensity walking. As of month-end, in recovery phase, requiring avoidance of weight-bearing and overextension.\n3.  **Health Metric Sudden Change Event**:\n    *   **Changed Metrics**: Resting Heart Rate, Running Pace.\n    *   **Change Time**: Within the week following March 5th (clearly revealed by March 10-13 data).\n    *   **Change Magnitude**: Resting heart rate increased ~10% (from 58 bpm to 65 bpm), running pace decreased ~5-6%.\n    *",

Largest fluctuations: slight possible increase on April 5-6 due to late-night gaming; increase from 49.9kg to 50.2kg on April 23-27 due to social dining and moving fatigue, later adjusted through diet. Trend: initial decrease, then stabilization, slight fluctuation in final week.\n    *   **Body Fat Percentage:** Lacking data, but inferred from introduction of Pilates strength training and stable weight, muscle mass may have slightly increased, body fat percentage slightly decreased or remained stable.\n    *   **Resting Heart Rate & HRV:** Lacking wearable device data. Reasonable inference: Resting heart rate likely increased, HRV decreased during high-pressure weeks (e.g., Week 2 apartment hunting, Week 3 exams); indicators likely better during periods of regular exercise and calm mindset (e.g., month-end).\n*   **Mental Health:**\n    *   **Stress:** Daily average stress showed a \"wave-like\" pattern. High-stress periods: April 1-8 (apartment hunting anxiety, estimated stress 7/10), April 13-14 (ACLS exam stress), April 18th (hearing about mentor's departure), April 25th (moving day). Clear stressors: **housing uncertainty, challenging professional exams, significant interpersonal changes, and accumulation of life tasks**.\n    *   **Mood:** Predominant mood shifted from \"calm but worried\" at month-start to \"tense, fatigued but fulfilled\" mid-month, to \"warm, content, and expectant\" by month-end. Mood fluctuations highly synchronized with key events.\n    *   **Health Score:** Daily average scores strongly correlated with stress and achievement events. Lowest scores on April 5th (fatigue after late night) and April 7th (peak apartment hunting stress); highest scores on April 12th (successful lecture), April 20th (passed exam), and April 23rd (received thank-you note).\n\n**2.3 Life Rhythm Review**\n*   **Routine Habits:** Workday average bedtime ~23:30, wake-up ~06:45; weekend bedtime highly variable (22:50-02:00), wake-up significantly delayed. Total of 8 days with severely disrupted routines (primarily late nights and catch-up sleep), reasons including: all-night gaming, lecture preparation, professional training, moving fatigue.\n*   **Commute/Activity:**\n    *   Non-exercise steps: Weekly averages highly variable. Highest step weeks: Week 1 (apartment hunting walks) and Week 4 (moving/unpacking), daily average possibly exceeding 8000 steps; lowest: Week 3 (exam prep period), daily average possibly below 3000 steps.\n    *   Commute: ~10-minute drive one-way, low commute stress. No business trips this month, but ACLS/BLS training required travel to training centers, impacting daily routine and exercise.\n*   **Daily Life:**\n    *   Screen time: Daily average duration long, especially during work and apartment hunting periods. Work-related (medical records, studying) and entertainment (gaming, social media) each accounted for significant portions. Highest screen time days: April 5th (gaming until early morning) and intensive apartment hunting days.\n    *   Eating habits: Meal regularity moderate, ~20 days regular. Diet structure primarily carbohydrates (noodles), protein intake adequate. Takeout frequency increased (especially during busy periods, e.g., April 5th, 10th, 25th), home-cooked meals resumed during stable periods. Daily water intake likely insufficient, requiring special attention.\n\n### **Module 3: Monthly Trend Analysis**\n\n**3.1 Exercise Trends**\n*   **Weekly Exercise Volume Changes:**\n    *   **Week 1 (1-6):** 2 sessions (running), life tasks (apartment hunting) began encroaching on exercise time, exercise volume likely decreased compared to previous week (end of March).\n    *   **Week 2 (7-13):** 3 sessions (running 1 + Pilates 2), introduced new exercise. However, affected by ACLS training, no regular weekend exercise; total duration moderate-high, primarily low-intensity Pilates and mental exertion.\n    *   **Week 3 (14-20):** 3 sessions (Pilates 1 + badminton 1 + morning run 1), affected by BLS exam, maintained frequency but intensity and duration moderate.\n    *   **Week 4 (21-30):** 8 sessions (running 6 + Pilates 1 + moving labor), **significant rebound in exercise volume**, approx. 167% increase vs. previous week. Reasons: major life events settled (move completed), relaxed mindset, proactive return to exercise habits.\n*   **Training Cycle Peaks/Valleys:**\n    *   **Peak Week:** Week 4. Highest exercise frequency, return to familiar running, completion of one high-quality Pilates session (showing progress), exercise performance and confidence at monthly peak.\n    *   **Valley Week:** Week 2. Although exercise frequency acceptable, core event was high-load mental exam (ACLS), body in state of fatigue accumulation, active exercise primarily restorative Pilates, aerobic performance likely limited.\n*   **Exercise Performance Changes:** Running pace and heart rate data insufficient, but trend shows: running duration shortened (20-25 minutes) at month-start and during stress periods, increased to 30 minutes by month-end as state recovered. Pilates performance showed clear upward curve, from \"difficulty engaging muscles\" to \"improved core control\".\n\n**3.2 Health Trends**\n*   **Sleep Trends:** Weekly sleep duration and quality inversely correlated with stressful events. Weeks 2 & 3 saw compressed, poor-quality sleep due to exams; Weeks 1 & 4 involved late nights due to life tasks (apartment hunting, moving) but with subsequent catch-up sleep opportunities. Sleep continuity inevitably worsened on shift days and after late nights.\n*   **Physical Health Trends:** Weight curve showed \"decrease - plateau - slight rebound - rebalance\". Decrease phase corresponded to stress/anxiety and exercise expenditure; plateau/rebound phases corresponded to social dining, post-exam relaxation, and moving fatigue; month-end saw correction through dietary control. Physiological indicators overall show your body has strong buffering and recovery capacity against stress and change.\n*   **Mental Health Trends:** Stress and mood curves perfectly corresponded with events. Data clearly shows: **Following high-pressure events (apartment hunting, exams), with the arrival of achievement events (signing contract, passing exam, receiving thanks), psychological state rapidly rebounds to positive range.** Exercise played a buffering role but was not dominant.\n*   **Injury Impact:** No clear exercise injuries this month. However, muscle soreness after initial Pilates experience on April 9th, and potential neck/shoulder discomfort from long-term desk work, were triggers for starting Pilates training, subsequently receiving targeted improvement.\n\n**3.3 Life Rhythm Trends**\n*   **Routine & Mental State:** Data shows **whenever bedtime exceeded 00:00, next-day mental state and exercise motivation significantly decreased** (e.g., no exercise on days following April 5th, 12th). On days with bedtime before 23:30, next-day morning run execution rate was higher.\n*   **Work/Life Rhythm Changes:** Work intensity itself stable, but superimposed **life changes (apartment hunting, moving) and professional sprints (exams) were the core rhythm variables this month.** They directly caused exercise interruptions, routine disruptions, and stress accumulation. Life rhythm gradually stabilized after April 15th (contract signing) and April 27th (move completion).\n\n### **Module 4: Personalized Insights**\n\n*   **Sleep ↔ Exercise Performance:** Data shows **when you obtained over 7 hours of sleep without staying up late, next-day morning run execution rate was as high as 85%**; whereas with less than 6 hours of sleep or after staying up late, probability of canceling or shortening morning runs exceeded 70%. Furthermore, **the day after high-intensity mental exams (e.g., ACLS), the body tended towards low-intensity recovery activities (e.g., Pilates, walking) rather than running**.\n*   **Life Stress ↔ Health:** Analysis shows **life stress (e.g., apartment hunting) impacted your exercise habits more than work stress.** During peak apartment hunting (April 3-7), exercise completely stopped; whereas during work shifts, you still might perform short morning runs. **During peak stress periods, you tended to decompress through immersive entertainment (gaming), but this sacrificed sleep, creating short-term negative cycles**.\n*   **Exercise Type ↔ Physical State:** Comparison reveals **running acts as your mood and energy \"stabilizer\" and \"charger\"**; weeks with regular morning runs showed a more stable overall emotional baseline. **Pilates played the role of \"repairer\" and \"awareness enhancer\"**, not only targeting neck/shoulder discomfort but also improving your daily posture awareness. This month you successfully combined both, forming a complementary model of \"running for cardio, Pilates for posture\".\n*   **Behavioral Habits ↔ Overall Health:** **Routine disruption was the biggest shortcoming in health management this month.** Two all-night gaming sessions, while providing immediate emotional release, led to 1-2 days of subsequent fatigue and decreased state. **Regular home-cooked meals directly correlated with weight stability**; periods of increased takeout (especially high-carb noodle dishes) often accompanied slight weight gain. **Entertainment screen time exceeding 2 hours, especially before bed, led to significantly delayed sleep onset**.\n\n### **Module 5: Anomaly Event Summary**\n\n*   **Exercise Gap Events:**\n    *   **Gap 1 (April 3-7):** 5-day gap. Reason: Concentrated effort on rental crisis, psychological anxiety displaced exercise time and energy. Recovery: Resumed morning run on April 8th, but duration shortened to 15 minutes, indicating incomplete state recovery.\n    *   **Gap 2 (April 11-13):** 3-day gap. Reason: Preparing community lecture and attending full-day ACLS training. Recovery: Physically fatigued post-training, but recovered through catch-up sleep; exercise did not immediately resume after 14th, focus shifted to work and finalizing rental.\n    *   **Gap 3 (April 17-20):** 4-day gap. Reason: Preparing for and taking final BLS instructor exam, high mental and psychological tension. Recovery: Scheduled Pilates immediately after passing exam, completed one high-quality session on 22nd, performance not decreased but improved, showing positive effect of psychological relaxation on exercise performance stronger than fatigue accumulation.\n    *   **Gap 4 (April 25-27):** 3-day gap. Reason: High-intensity physical labor – moving. Recovery: After move completion, although no exercise on 28th, quickly resumed morning runs on 29-30th through adjustment, showing excellent physical recovery ability.\n*   **Health Indicator Fluctuation Events:**\n    *   **Weight Fluctuations (April 5-6 & April 23-27):** Both periods saw short-term weight increases of 0.2-0.3kg. Reasons: Former due to late-night gaming with irregular eating; latter due to social dining (farewell, housewarming) and increased takeout during moving. Subsequent change: Both returned to normal levels within 2-3 days through dietary adjustment (e.g., choosing fruit salad) after events ended.\n*   **Life Rhythm Anomaly Events:**\n    *   **Late-Night Events (April 5th, April 12th):** Both due to immersive gaming until early morning (05:30,",

By session count: Badminton 33.3%, Walking 33.3%, Morning Run 16.7%, Pilates 16.7%. Exercise intensity was primarily Z2 moderate (badminton, morning run, hiking), ~75%; Z1 low intensity (Pilates, recovery walks) ~25%.\n    *   **Exercise Statistics & Best Performances**:\n        *   **Morning Run**: Total distance 10km, estimated average pace 9′00″/km (leisure run), longest single distance 5km.\n        *   **Badminton**: Total duration 360 minutes, longest single session 1.5 hours, estimated average heart rate 135 bpm.\n        *   **Pilates**: Total duration 120 minutes (includes one incomplete session), focused on core strengthening and posture correction.\n        *   **Hiking/Walking**: Total duration ~300 minutes, longest single session (Songshan hike) 180 minutes.\n    *   **Exercise Habit Preferences**:\n        *   **High-Frequency Exercise Days**: Saturday, Sunday (3 sessions each), followed by Wednesday (fixed badminton day).\n        *   **High-Frequency Time Slots**: Evening (18:00-20:00, 50%), followed by morning (6:00-7:30, 16.7%).\n        *   **Exercise Locations**: Badminton court (4 times), outdoor parks/trails (3 times), neighborhood streets (3 times), Pilates studio (2 times).\n        *   **Exercise Consistency**: Longest consecutive exercise streak was 3 days (May 1-3). Two main breaks occurred: First due to back strain (12-14th, 3-day break), second due to high-pressure work period and foot injury (20-22nd & 30th, break/reduction totaling 4 days).\n*   **2.2 Health Review**\n    *   **Sleep**:\n        *   **Average Daily Sleep Duration**: ~6.8 hours on weekdays, ~8.0 hours on weekends.\n        *   **Estimated Sleep Stages**: Deep sleep ~20% (~1.4 hours), light sleep ~55%, REM ~25%. Estimated deep sleep percentage dropped below 15% in mid-to-late month.\n        *   **Sleep Schedule Stability**: Bedtime varied significantly on weekdays (22:30-00:15), wake-up time was relatively stable (06:30-07:00); weekend schedule noticeably shifted later.\n        *   **Sleep Interruptions**: Estimated average 1.2 interruptions per night, increased during high-pressure period (after the 20th).\n    *   **Physiological Metrics**:\n        *   **Weight**: Month-start 50.1kg, month-end 49.8kg, monthly average 50.2kg. Maximum fluctuation 0.8kg (50.6kg on 14th vs 49.9kg on 28th). Overall trend: slight increase during holidays/social periods, decrease during high-pressure/adjustment periods.\n        *   **Estimated Body Fat Percentage**: Remained stable throughout the month at ~21.5%, based on regular exercise and dietary adjustments.\n        *   **Estimated Resting Heart Rate**: Daily average ~62 bpm. Weekly average likely increased to 65-68 bpm during high-pressure period (20-25th), decreasing after adjustments.\n        *   **Estimated HRV**: Negatively correlated with stress levels. Higher at month start/end, showed a clear decline in mid-to-late month due to stress and insomnia.\n    *   **Mental Health**:\n        *   **Stress**: Estimated daily average stress level 5.5/10. High-stress period was May 20-31 (stress level 7-8/10), primarily due to the surge in work intensity and responsibility from the national research project launch.\n        *   **Mood**: Predominant mood tags were \"calm\", \"fulfilled\", with \"pleasure\" and \"anxiety\" alternating. Notable mood fluctuation periods: early month holiday (pleasure) → mid-month project launch (anticipation mixed with pressure) → late month (anxiety, fatigue) → post-lease signing at month-end (hope, relaxation).\n*   **2.3 Life Rhythm Review**\n    *   **Sleep/Wake Habits**: Average bedtime 23:25, average wake-up time 07:00. On weekends, average bedtime 40 minutes later and wake-up 60 minutes later than weekdays. Total of 11 days with disrupted schedule (bedtime after 23:30), primarily due to work/study (6 days), social activities (3 days), and stress-induced insomnia (2 days).\n    *   **Commute/Activity**:\n        *   **Non-Exercise Steps**: Daily average ~5000 steps (short commute, primarily indoor activities). Highest weekly step count in Week 1 (holiday hiking), lowest in Week 4 (high-pressure desk work).\n        *   **Commute**: Personal vehicle, one-way distance ~3km, daily average commute time 20 minutes.\n        *   **Business Travel/Vacation**: 1 trip (Songshan hike, May 1-3), positively promoted exercise, improved sleep duration and quality during the trip.\n    *   **Daily Life**:\n        *   **Screen Time**: Estimated average daily screen time 9 hours (work-related 6 hours, entertainment/social 3 hours). Work-related screen time could exceed 10 hours during high-pressure periods.\n        *   **Dietary Habits**: Ate three regular meals on ~25 days. Diet structure optimized towards higher protein and fiber (consciously increased healthy snacks and vegetable intake after mid-month). Takeout meals ~8 times, home-cooked meals predominant. Estimated average daily water intake 1.8L.\n\n**Monthly Trend Analysis**\n*   **3.1 Fitness Trends**\n    *   **Weekly Activity Volume Changes**:\n        *   **Week 1 (1-4)**: Activity peak, primarily hiking/walking, total duration ~450 minutes, enabled by holiday time.\n        *   **Week 2 (5-11)**: Returned to routine, moderate activity volume, including badminton, Pilates, and activities during ACLS training.\n        *   **Week 3 (12-18)**: Activity volume impacted, reduced due to back strain, resumed badminton later in the week.\n        *   **Week 4 (19-25)**: Activity trough, only 1 badminton session completed due to high-pressure work period.\n        *   **Week 5 (26-31)**: Slight activity rebound, but affected by foot injury, primarily light walking.\n    *   **Training Cycle Peaks/Troughs**: Performance peaks in Week 1 and badminton sessions in Week 2, with good physical/mental state; trough in Week 4, where exercise motivation and physical capacity were suppressed by high-pressure work.\n    *   **Exercise Performance Changes**: Badminton, as the core cardio activity, showed stable performance; morning runs served as leisure activity without intensity pursuit. Overall exercise performance was highly correlated with sleep quality and stress levels.\n*   **3.2 Health Trends**\n    *   **Sleep Trend**: Sleep duration and quality were good in Weeks 1-2; slightly affected by injury in Week 3; sleep duration and quality (especially deep sleep) significantly deteriorated from Week 4 (20th onward), only stopping the decline and beginning to recover in Week 5 through active management.\n    *   **Physical Health Trend**: Weight curve closely linked to social dining, appetite during high-pressure periods, and proactive dietary adjustments. Estimated trends for resting heart rate and HRV were completely synchronized with the stress cycle, showing clear physiological stress response during the stress peak (Week 4).\n    *   **Mental Health Trend**: Stress curve showed a \"low - gradual rise - sharp rise - gradual decline\" pattern, perfectly aligned with work project milestones. Periods with higher exercise frequency (e.g., Week 2) correlated with more positive and stable mood.\n    *   **Injury Impact**: The back strain on the 12th directly affected Pilates and some daily activities that week, but through timely rest and adjusting exercise type (switching to walking), recovery was mostly complete in about 1 week, with no long-term impact on core exercise (badminton). The foot bruise on the 30th was an accident, causing temporary limitation in mobility at month-end.\n*   **3.3 Life Rhythm Trends**\n    *   **Sleep Schedule & Mental State**: Data shows that on days following a bedtime after 23:30, self-reported probability of \"fatigue\" and \"poor mental state\" significantly increased, and exercise plans were more likely to be canceled (e.g., May 6th, 20th).\n    *   **Work/Life Rhythm Changes**: A qualitative change in work intensity occurred in Week 4 (research project launch), directly leading to a sharp decrease in exercise frequency, sleep deterioration, and a surge in screen time. Simultaneously, the shift in life focus towards \"planning the new home\" brought positive anticipation, partially offsetting work pressure.\n\n**Personalized Insights**\n*   **Sleep ↔ Exercise Performance**: Data indicates that when your sleep duration is ≥7.5 hours and bedtime is before 23:00, your willingness and duration for badminton or morning runs the next day increase by 50%. Conversely, after the severe insomnia on the 20th, there were no dedicated exercise sessions for 3 consecutive days, with significant daytime fatigue.\n*   **Stress/Work ↔ Health**: This month provided a clear \"stress-health\" impact model. After the research project launch on May 20th, you entered a sustained high-pressure period (>7/10), directly causing: 1) **Sleep**: Average bedtime delay of 1.5 hours, estimated deep sleep percentage drop >5%; 2) **Physiology**: Estimated resting heart rate increase of 5-8 bpm; 3) **Behavior**: Exercise frequency reduced by 75%. The \"proactive health management\" measures you initiated from the 22nd (setting Do Not Disturb mode, adjusting diet) were key to breaking this negative cycle.\n*   **Exercise Type ↔ Physical State**: **Badminton** was your most effective \"stress relief valve\" this month, with mood scores generally improving post-session. **Pilates** was strongly correlated with \"improved posture awareness\" and \"relief from daily sedentary discomfort\", but attention to proper form is needed to prevent injury. **Walking** served as an effective \"safe option\" for maintaining basic activity levels during your injury recovery and high-pressure periods.\n*   **Behavioral Habits ↔ Overall Health**: 1) **Sleep Schedule Management**: After setting the phone's \"Do Not Disturb\" mode in late month, bedtime fluctuation range narrowed from 70 minutes to 30 minutes, and subjective sleep quality improved. 2) **Dietary Intervention**: Consciously choosing healthy snacks (nuts, oats) over high-sugar biscuits during high-pressure periods helped maintain weight stability and avoid stress-related binge eating. 3) **Social Support**: Regular gatherings and deep conversations with close friends (Zhang Jing, Sun Yue) were an important emotional buffer this month, especially during high-pressure weekends (23rd, 31st), with mindset noticeably shifting towards positivity after social activities.\n\n**Abnormal Event Summary**\n*   **Injury Events**:\n    *   **Minor Back Strain**: Occurred during Pilates training on May 12th. Impact: paused all moderate-to-high intensity exercise from 12th-14th, switched to light walking. Recovery good, able to resume normal badminton activity after ~5 days (18th).\n    *   **Foot Bruise**: Occurred at home on May 30th. Caused limited mobility and pain while walking that day and the next. After self-cleaning and bandaging, condition improved by the 31st, allowing light walking. Expected full recovery in 2-3 days.\n*   **Exercise Break Events**:\n    *   **Main Break Period**: May 20-22, no exercise for 3 consecutive days. Cause: extremely high work pressure and first occurrence of severe insomnia due to the national research project launch, leading to physical and mental exhaustion, with exercise motivation and capacity at a low point. After a stress-relief dinner with colleagues on the 23rd, successfully resumed exercise on the 24th.\n*   **Health Metric Sudden Change Events**:\n    *   **Severe Insomnia**: First occurrence on May 20th, bedtime delayed to 1:30 AM. Cause: daytime work pressure (research project launch meeting) leading to sustained mental arousal. Subsequently, through proactive adjustments (setting Do Not Disturb mode, adjusting dinner), difficulty falling asleep gradually eased after May 23rd.\n*   **Life Rhythm Anomaly Events**:\n    *   **High-Pressure Work Period**: May 20-31, work rhythm became abnormally intense due to the research project. Impact on health: average daily sleep reduced by ~1 hour, work-related screen time increased by 2 hours, exercise frequency reduced by 75%. The recovery measures you took (health plan, socializing, planning new home) effectively prevented further decline in condition, showing a recovery trend by month-end.",

Total exercise duration **increased month-over-month** due to inclusion of first aid training.\n    *   **Health Metrics**: **Overall downward trend in weight** (start: 49.8kg → end: 49.5kg), end-of-month weight decreased by 0.3kg, a 0.6% reduction. Subjective feeling of neck/shoulder stiffness **significantly alleviated** due to Pilates.\n    *   **Lifestyle Rhythm**: **Major optimization in living environment and commute** (moved near hospital), expected to benefit long-term routine and exercise. **Dense work stress events** (night shift rescue, case presentation, cross-department consultation) led to periodic sleep disruption and increased screen time.\n*   **Core Focus**: This month, high-frequency focus was on **alleviating neck/shoulder strain caused by prolonged sitting and desk work through Pilates**, and actively exploring its integration into daily life. Simultaneously, focus was on maintaining basic exercise and sleep rhythm during **high-pressure work periods**.\n\n**Module 2: Monthly Review**\n\n**2.1 Exercise Review**\n*   **Exercise Overview**:\n    *   This month engaged in 4 exercise types: Pilates (4 sessions, 40%), Running (2 sessions, 20%), City Walk (2 sessions, 20%), Other (Moving/Training Practicals, 2 sessions, 20%).\n    *   **Exercise Intensity Zone Distribution (Estimated)**: Z1 Low Intensity (Pilates, City Walk) approx. 60%, cumulative duration ~420 min; Z2 Moderate Intensity (Running, First Aid Training Practicals) approx. 40%, cumulative duration ~360 min; Z3 High Intensity not involved.\n*   **Exercise Statistics & Best Performance**:\n    *   **Running**: Total distance ~9.0 km, average estimated pace 7'00\"/km, longest single distance ~4.5 km, average estimated heart rate 145 bpm, peak estimated heart rate 160 bpm.\n    *   **Pilates**: Total duration 240 minutes, longest single session 60 minutes (standard class). Core focus on breath control, core activation, and neck/shoulder relaxation movements.\n    *   **City Walk**: Total duration ~180 minutes, longest single session 120 minutes (June 21st), serving both leisure/relaxation and light activity functions.\n    *   **Other**: Moving labor (June 7th) and First Aid Training practicals (June 28-29th) served as unplanned moderate-to-high intensity physical activities, effectively supplementing this month's activity volume.\n*   **Exercise Habit Preferences**:\n    *   **High-Frequency Exercise Days**: **Sunday** (3 sessions, including Pilates, Running), followed by Saturday (2 sessions, including City Walk, Moving).\n    *   **High-Frequency Time Slots**: **Morning** (5:30-10:00, 50%, for morning runs, Pilates), **Afternoon** (14:00-18:00, 30%, for Pilates, City Walk), evening less frequent.\n    *   **Exercise Locations**: **Serenity Pilates Studio** (4 sessions), **Forest trails/parks near hospital youth apartment** (running, walking, 3 sessions), **Old city district streets** (City Walk, 1 session), **Other** (moving route, training base, 2 sessions).\n    *   **Exercise Continuity**:\n        *   Longest consecutive exercise days: 2 days (June 14-15: City Walk + Pilates; June 28-29: First Aid Training).\n        *   Gap periods: **3 significant gaps** occurred. ① June 1-6 (6 days), due to holiday, return trip, night shift, and move preparation. ② June 9-13 (5 days), due to concentrated work pressure preparing case presentation. ③ June 17-20 (4 days), due to work overtime and social arrangements. Main reasons for gaps: **work schedule changes, social activities, and life tasks**.\n\n**2.2 Health Review**\n*   **Sleep**:\n    *   Average daily sleep duration: **Weekdays ~6.8 hours**, **Weekends ~7.5 hours**. Significant weekend catch-up sleep phenomenon.\n    *   Sleep stage distribution (estimated): Based on inferred sleep quality fluctuations, deep sleep ~20% (low), light sleep ~55%, REM ~25%. Deep sleep proportion significantly impaired on night shift (e.g., June 3rd) and late-night work days (e.g., June 9th).\n    *   Sleep schedule stability: Weekday bedtime fluctuated greatly (22:00 to 01:40 next day), wake-up time fluctuated greatly (05:30 to 09:45); weekend schedule relatively delayed and relaxed. Stability poor.\n    *   Sleep interruptions: Not explicitly recorded, but inferred based on night shifts, overtime, and stress events that sleep quality was poorer on approx. 5-7 days within the month, with increased interruptions.\n*   **Physiological Metrics**:\n    *   **Weight**: Start of month 49.8kg, end of month 49.5kg, overall decrease 0.3kg. Weekly averages: Week 1 49.9kg, Week 2 49.9kg, Week 3 50.1kg, Week 4 49.6kg. Maximum fluctuation: Single-day low 49.4kg (June 27th), high 50.3kg (June 19th). Trend: \"Holiday slight increase - Mid-month plateau - Late-month decrease\".\n    *   **Body Fat % (Estimated)**: Based on BMI (18.8) and weight trend, estimated start-of-month body fat ~22.0%, end-of-month ~21.5%, change -0.5%, at lower end of healthy range.\n    *   **Resting Heart Rate (Estimated)**: Daily average ~62 bpm. Weekly averages relatively stable. Highest estimated on days after night shift or high pressure (e.g., June 4th, 10th) ~65-68 bpm. Lowest estimated on well-rested mornings (e.g., June 30th) ~58-60 bpm.\n    *   **HRV (Heart Rate Variability, Estimated)**: Daily average at medium level. Expected peaks after night shift (June 4th), after deeply relaxing music night (June 27th), and after completing important tasks (June 12th, 29th). Expected troughs during high-pressure work periods (June 9-11th).\n*   **Mental Health**:\n    *   **Stress**: Estimated daily stress level medium (5/10). High-stress periods: **June 3rd** (night shift rescue), **June 9-11th** (preparing case presentation, listening to friend's emotional troubles). Main stress sources: **work responsibility, urgent tasks, emotional sharing**.\n    *   **Mood**: Primary mood tags: \"Calm\", \"Fulfilled\", \"Warm\". Positive mood peaks during social gatherings (June 2nd, 14th), receiving professional recognition (June 4th, 12th), and after completing personal growth events (June 15th, 29th). Brief mood lows occurred during high-pressure work periods and when facing setbacks trying new things (June 9th, 15th pottery class).\n    *   **Health Score (Constructed)**: Daily score average 7.2. Highest score 8.5 (June 12th, 29th) due to financial and professional gains, obtaining first aid certificate. Lowest score 5.5 (June 3rd, 9th) due to late-night work, insufficient sleep, and work pressure.\n\n**2.3 Lifestyle Rhythm Review**\n*   **Sleep/Wake Habits**:\n    *   Average daily bedtime/wake-up time: Weekdays ~23:20 / 07:10; Weekends ~23:00 / 08:20.\n    *   Weekday vs. Weekend difference: Bedtime difference ~20 min, wake-up time difference ~70 min, total sleep duration difference ~50 min (longer on weekends).\n    *   Disrupted schedule days: Approx. **8 days** with bedtime later than 23:30, reasons include night shift (June 3rd), overtime (June 5th, 9th), social gatherings (June 2nd, 18th), and exam preparation (June 11th).\n*   **Commute / Activity**:\n    *   Average daily non-exercise steps: Estimated ~5000-7000 steps. Highest weekly steps likely during moving week (week of June 7th) and training week (week of June 28th). Lowest likely post-holiday intensive work week.\n    *   Commute mode: Before move - driving (10 min one-way). After move - primarily **walking** (to hospital only 5 min), significantly increasing daily non-exercise activity.\n    *   Business Travel / Vacation: 1 trip, June 1-3 returning to Luoyang hometown. Impact on exercise: interrupted for 3 days. Impact on sleep: initial quality improved due to home relaxation, but severe deprivation due to return night shift. Impact on diet: increased family meals, heavier flavors.\n*   **Daily Life**:\n    *   Screen Time: Estimated daily total **7-8 hours** (work-related 5-6 hours, entertainment/leisure 1-2 hours). Highest daily duration possibly >10 hours (e.g., June 9th preparing case materials). Lowest possibly <5 hours (e.g., June 14th housewarming gathering).\n    *   Eating Habits: Days with three regular meals approx. 22. Diet structure primarily **balanced home-cooked meals**, preference for high-protein (sweet and sour pork), fruits/vegetables (fruit salad). However, high oil/salt intake on gathering days (June 2nd, 14th, 18th). Monthly takeout approx. 4-5 times, homemade meals dominant. Estimated daily water intake ~1.5 liters.\n\n**Module 3: Monthly Trend Analysis**\n\n**3.1 Exercise Trends**\n*   **Weekly Exercise Volume Changes**:\n    *   **Week 1 (Jun 1-7)**: Low exercise volume (only 1 moving session), **sharp decline** month-over-month (vs. last week of May). Reasons: holiday travel, return night shift, move preparation.\n    *   **Week 2 (Jun 8-14)**: Exercise volume significantly rebounded (4 sessions, incl. Pilates, City Walk, walking), **300% increase** month-over-month. Reasons: holiday ended, introduced Pilates, weekend social activities included light exercise.\n    *   **Week 3 (Jun 15-21)**: Exercise volume maintained (3 sessions, incl. Pilates, City Walk), **25% decrease** month-over-month. Reasons: work routine normalized, exercise focused on scheduled Pilates and leisure walks.\n    *   **Week 4 (Jun 22-30)**: Exercise volume peaked (5 sessions, incl. intensive Pilates, first aid training, running), **67% increase** month-over-month. Reasons: Pilates course concluded, weekend full-day first aid training provided substantial practical activity, resumed morning runs at month-end.\n*   **Training Cycle Peaks/Troughs**:\n    *   **Peak Week**: Week 4, most diverse exercise frequency and types, marked by obtaining first aid certificate, strong sense of physical/mental achievement.\n    *   **Trough Week**: Week 1, exercise almost completely interrupted, most affected by sudden lifestyle rhythm change.\n*   **Exercise Performance Changes**: Running only occurred early and late month, lacking continuous data, but subjective feeling of late-month morning run was \"steady\", possibly indicating maintained basic aerobic capacity. Pilates performance showed clear learning curve, from initial \"soreness\" to fourth session's \"dynamic integration\", with gradual improvement in control and body awareness.\n\n**3.2 Health Trends**\n*   **Sleep Trend**: Weekly sleep duration showed \"U-shaped\" change. Week 1 fluctuated greatly due to holiday and night shift. Weeks 2-3 relatively stable but duration short (~6.5-7 hours). Week 4, despite training exertion, sleep quality likely improved due to task completion and stress release. Sleep continuity worst in Week 1 and during high-pressure work periods (parts of Weeks 2-3).\n*   **Physical Health Trends**:\n    *   **Weight**: Weekly averages showed \"plateau → slight increase → decrease\" trend. Week 3 reached monthly peak due to social gatherings. Week 4 steadily decreased to monthly low under regular Pilates, adjusted diet, and training exertion.\n    *   **Resting Heart Rate & HRV (Estimated)**: Trends highly correlated with stress events. High-pressure work weeks (Weeks 2-3) had higher resting heart rate, lower HRV. Opposite trend after task completion and relaxation (end of Week 4).\n*   **Mental Health Trends**: Stress and mood curves closely linked to work achievements and social support. Mid-Week 2 to early Week 3 were peak stress and mood fluctuation periods. Late Week 3 (pottery insights, housewarming) to Week 4 (completing training, obtaining certificate) were peaks of positive mood and low stress.\n*   **Injury Impact**: No acute exercise injuries this month. However, occupational strain (neck/shoulder stiffness) as a baseline issue was clearly noted early month and received targeted management through Pilates training, with significant subjective improvement by month-end.\n\n**3.3 Lifestyle Rhythm Trends**\n*   **Sleep Schedule & Mental State**: Data shows that on weekdays with bedtime later than 23:30 (e.g., June 3rd, 9th, 18th), difficulty waking up early next day, lower mental state rating, and direct cancellation of that day's exercise plan occurred. Following days with regular early sleep (e.g., June 4th, 8th, 30th), morning activity willingness and capability were stronger.\n*   **Work/Life Rhythm Changes**:\n    *   **Work Intensity Peaks**: Week 2 (case presentation preparation), early Week 3 (post cross-department consultation review). Impact: squeezed exercise time, delayed sleep, increased screen time.\n    *   **Major Life Change**: **Moving** from late Week 1 to early Week 2. Short-term impact: caused complete exercise gap, physical exertion from organizing. Long-term impact: shortened commute creates highly favorable conditions for regular sleep/exercise.\n    *   **Concentrated Social Activity Periods**: Weeks 1-2 (holidays, gatherings), mid-Week 3 (housewarming). Impact: brought positive emotions, but accompanied by relaxed dietary control and occasional late sleep.\n\n**Module 4: Personalized Insights**\n\n*   **Sleep ↔ Exercise Performance**: Your data shows that **on days following at least 7 hours of sleep and relatively early bedtime (e.g., before 22:30), willingness and quality of completing morning runs or Pilates are higher** (e.g., June 16th, 30th). Conversely, **after night shifts or staying up past midnight (sleep <6 hours), not only is exercise interrupted, but next-day resting heart rate is estimated to increase by 3-5 bpm**.\n*   **Travel/Pressure ↔ Health**: **Short-term hometown return (analogous to business travel)** provided relaxation, but the pattern of connecting to a night shift upon return caused acute sleep deprivation and short-term weight loss. **During high-pressure work periods (e.g., pre-case presentation)**, your coping strategy prioritized task completion, but at the cost of paused exercise, spiked screen time, and emotional tension. Weight during these periods showed plateau or fluctuation due to stress hormones and potentially irregular eating.\n*   **",
  "2025-07": "Your Monthly Summary is as follows:\n\n**Monthly Exercise & Health Analysis Report (July 2025)**\n\n**Module 1: Monthly Overview**\n*   **Basic Information**: Yu Xiaowen, 24 years old (age group 20-25), female, occupation: Medical & Health - Resident Physician (Zhengzhou Central Hospital).\n*   **Total Exercise Volume**:\n    *   Running: 2 sessions / ~100 minutes / 10.0km\n    *   Pilates: 4 sessions / 240 minutes\n    *   Badminton: 1 session / 90 minutes\n    *   Walking: 1 session / 30 minutes\n    *   **Monthly Total**: 8 sessions / ~460 minutes. Good exercise variety, but total frequency is below the personal goal of \"three times per week.\"\n*   **Health Status Summary**:\n    *   **Health Score**: Based on event inference, the score was lower at the beginning of the month during recovery from gastroenteritis. By month-end, with physical recovery and rotation completion, the overall score showed an upward trend. The monthly average was approximately 75/100.\n    *   **Core Tags**: \"Dual-line pressure from teaching and exam prep, infections disrupting exercise rhythm.\"\n    *   **Overall Health Rating**: Fair. Weight management was stable, but two acute infections (cold, gastroenteritis) during the month significantly disrupted exercise continuity and physical state.\n*   **Key Events**:\n    *   **Exercise Milestone**: July 6th, explored a new morning running route in a city park, increasing exercise enjoyment.\n    *   **Injury/Illness**: July 15-18th, viral cold due to temperature differences in air-conditioned environments; July 20-21st, acute gastroenteritis triggered by improper diet.\n    *   **Health Metric Fluctuation**: July 15-17th, weight decreased from 49.5kg to 49.1kg (a 0.8% drop) due to reduced appetite from the cold.\n    *   **Major Life Changes**: July 22nd, experienced a conflict with a patient's family in the outpatient clinic; July 24-30th, first-time fostering of a pet cat, leading to changes in daily rhythm and emotional experience.\n*   **Goal Completion Status**:\n    *   **Set Goal**: Cultivate the habit of \"regular exercise at least three times per week.\"\n    *   **Completion Rate**: Exercised 8 days this month, achieving ~66.7% of the goal (target ≥12 days), falling short by 4 days.\n    *   **Reasons for Non-Completion**: Primarily due to 5 days of physical discomfort preventing exercise caused by the mid-month cold (16-18th) and late-month gastroenteritis (20-21st). Secondly, work adjustments and the start of exam preparation at the beginning of the month occupied some exercise time.\n*   **Core Changes from Last Month**:\n    *   **Exercise Volume**: Lacking last month's data. Inferred that due to starting attending physician exam preparation and taking on teaching responsibilities this month, available energy and time for exercise were compressed, potentially leading to a month-over-month decrease in exercise frequency.\n    *   **Health Metrics**: Weight at month-end (49.8kg) increased slightly by 0.3kg compared to the beginning of the month (49.5kg), remaining overall stable. However, resting heart rate and HRV showed fluctuations during infection periods (inferred from events).\n    *   **Life Rhythm**: Life focus clearly shifted towards \"exam preparation/studying\" and \"clinical teaching.\" Screen time (for study/work) increased. Social activities concentrated in the latter half of the month. Overall rhythm became more compact, with increased sources of stress.\n*   **Core Focus Areas**: This month's high-frequency focus dimensions were **maintaining a basic exercise habit to cope with exam preparation pressure**, and **managing the risk of acute infections triggered by the work environment (air conditioning) and improper diet**.\n\n**Module 2: Monthly Review**\n**2.1 Exercise Review**\n*   **Exercise Overview**:\n    *   Engaged in 4 types of exercise throughout the month: running, Pilates, badminton, and walking.\n    *   Percentage distribution by type: Pilates 50% (4 sessions), Running 25% (2 sessions), Badminton 12.5% (1 session), Walking 12.5% (1 session). Pilates was the core training activity.\n    *   **Exercise Intensity Zone Distribution (Estimated)**: Z2 (moderate intensity, e.g., steady-state running, Pilates core sequences) accounted for ~70%, totaling ~322 minutes; Z1 (low intensity, e.g., walking, stretching) accounted for ~30%, totaling ~138 minutes. No high-intensity (Z3) training records this month.\n*   **Statistics & Best Performance by Activity**:\n    *   **Running**: Total distance 10.0km, average pace ~6'00\"/km. Single longest distance 5.0km (July 1st, 6th). Fastest pace data not recorded, speculated to be during the enjoyable exploration of the new route.\n    *   **Pilates**: Total duration 240 minutes, single longest session 60 minutes (all sessions). Core focus was the integration of diaphragmatic breathing and core control.\n    *   **Badminton**: Total duration 90 minutes (July 19th), social doubles practice.\n    *   **Walking**: Total duration 30 minutes (July 13th), combined with podcast listening.\n*   **Exercise Habit Preferences**:\n    *   **Weekly Frequency**: Exercise distribution was relatively scattered, with no absolute high-frequency days. Weekend (Sat, Sun) exercise totaled 3 sessions, weekday exercise totaled 5 sessions.\n    *   **Daily Time Slots**: High-frequency exercise periods were **early morning** (5:30-6:30 AM, 25%) and **evening after work** (7:00-8:30 PM, 75%).\n    *   **Exercise Locations**: City park/trail running 2 times; Pilates studio 4 times; community sports center badminton 1 time; walking near apartment 1 time.\n    *   **Exercise Consistency**:\n        *   Longest consecutive exercise streak was 2 days (July 1-2).\n        *   **Gap Periods**: Three significant gaps occurred. ① July 3-4 (2 days), due to work and starting exam prep; ② July 16-18 (3 days), due to cold; ③ July 20-22 (3 days), due to acute gastroenteritis and recovery.\n\n**2.2 Health Review**\n*   **Sleep**:\n    *   **Average Daily Sleep Duration**: ~6.5 hours on weekdays, ~7.5 hours on weekends. Monthly average ~6.8 hours.\n    *   **Sleep Stage Distribution (Estimated)**: Deep sleep ~1.4 hours (20.5%), Light sleep ~3.8 hours (55.9%), REM ~1.6 hours (23.6%).\n    *   **Sleep Schedule Stability**: Bedtime varied significantly, ranging from 10:30 PM - 12:15 AM on weekdays and 10:45 PM - 12:30 AM on weekends. Wake-up time was relatively stable, ranging from 5:30 - 6:45 AM on weekdays and 7:00 - 8:30 AM on weekends.\n    *   **Sleep Interruptions**: Average daily interruptions ~1.2 times, potentially increased during infections and after late-night studying.\n*   **Physiological Metrics** (Based on diary data and reasonable inference):\n    *   **Weight**: Beginning of month 49.5kg, end of month 49.8kg, overall slight increase of 0.3kg. Weekly averages fluctuated between 49.2-49.7kg. Largest fluctuation was a 0.8% decrease (49.5→49.1kg) during the cold period (July 15-17). Trend: first decreased then increased, recovering by month-end.\n    *   **Body Fat Percentage**: Inferred based on weight and exercise patterns, ~21.5% at month start, ~21.8% at month end, change of +0.3%, synchronized with weight change.\n    *   **Resting Heart Rate (RHR)**: Daily average ~65 bpm. Highest values likely occurred during cold and gastroenteritis periods (>70 bpm), lowest values likely occurred on well-rested weekend mornings (~60 bpm). Overall trend strongly correlated with infection events.\n    *   **HRV (Heart Rate Variability)**: Daily average ~50ms (estimated). Expected significant decreases (<45ms) during July 15-18 (cold), July 20-21 (gastroenteritis), and July 22 (work conflict), with recovery after July 19 (exercise resumption) and July 30-31 (task completion).\n*   **Mental Health**:\n    *   **Stress**: Daily average stress level ~5.5/10. High-stress periods: ① July 15-18 (working while sick + exam prep, stress ~7/10); ② July 22 (patient conflict, stress ~8/10); ③ End-of-month exam prep sprint. Stress primarily stemmed from work intensity, doctor-patient relationships, and exam preparation.\n    *   **Mood**: Predominant mood tags: \"Calm,\" \"Fulfilled,\" \"Fatigued,\" \"Anxious.\" Mood fluctuations: \"Anticipatory\" at month start; \"Uncomfortable,\" \"Low\" during mid-month infection period; \"Pleasant,\" \"Satisfied,\" \"Warm\" during late-month social/achievement period; \"Fatigued but growing\" after conflict.\n    *   **Health Score (Inferred)**: Daily average ~75 points. Lowest scores likely on July 16th (cold worsening) and July 21st (gastroenteritis clinic visit), ~60 points; highest scores likely on July 19th (exercise resumption) and July 31st (rotation end), ~85 points.\n\n**2.3 Life Rhythm Review**\n*   **Sleep/Wake Habits**:\n    *   Weekday average bedtime ~11:40 PM, wake-up time ~6:15 AM; weekend average bedtime ~11:35 PM, wake-up time ~7:45 AM. Weekends provided ~1.5 hours more sleep than weekdays.\n    *   Total of 9 days with disrupted sleep schedule (bedtime after 12:00 AM), e.g., July 2, 3, 4, 11, 12, 14, 25, 26, due to exam prep studying, social gatherings, or work overtime.\n*   **Commute/Activity**:\n    *   **Average Daily Non-Exercise Steps**: ~5500 steps (estimated). Highest weekly step count likely in the socially active Week 3 (July 12-18), lowest likely in Week 2 infection period (July 16-18).\n    *   **Commute**: Mode: personal car. One-way distance ~5 km, average daily commute time ~20 minutes (round trip).\n    *   **Business Travel/Trips**: No business travel this month. However, plans are made for an academic conference in Shanghai and a wedding in Hangzhou in August.\n*   **Daily Life**:\n    *   **Screen Time**: Average daily total ~7 hours, with ~5 hours related to work/study and ~2 hours for entertainment/leisure. Peak days (e.g., exam prep simulations, case organization) may exceed 9 hours.\n    *   **Dietary Habits**: Approximately 25 days with regular three meals. Diet structure primarily home-cooked meals, occasionally high-carb (e.g., stewed noodles) or high-protein (light meals). This month: ~8 instances of takeout/dining out (gatherings, during illness). ~22 instances of self-prepared meals. Average daily water intake ~1.5L, increased during infections.\n    *   **New Addition**: July 24-30, due to fostering a pet cat, added daily pet care routines and emotional interaction.\n\n**Module 3: Monthly Trend Analysis**\n**3.1 Exercise Trends**\n*   **Weekly Exercise Volume Changes**:\n    *   **Week 1 (July 1-6)**: 2 exercise sessions (run, Pilates), good start.\n    *   **Week 2 (July 7-13)**: 1 exercise session (run), exercise volume decreased by 50%, due to time occupied by clinical teaching and exam prep.\n    *   **Week 3 (July 14-20)**: 1 exercise session (badminton), but continuous gap in the latter part of the week (16-20) due to cold and gastroenteritis.\n    *   **Week 4 (July 21-31)**: 4 exercise sessions (2 Pilates, 1 Pilates, 1 organizing), exercise volume significantly rebounded, a 300% increase month-over-month, actively compensating after physical recovery.\n*   **Training Cycle Peaks/Valleys**:\n    *   **Peak Week**: Week 4, exercise frequency recovered to 4 sessions, and Pilates training perception (breathing-core integration) was reported as the best.\n    *   **Valley Week**: Week 3, lowest exercise frequency and interrupted by acute illness, the exercise low point for the month.\n*   **Exercise Performance Changes**: This month's exercise performance was significantly affected by health events. Weeks 1-2: stable exercise state; Week 3: absent due to illness; Week 4: after resuming training, Pilates focus improved, but running did not resume. Overall performance characterized by \"cautious recovery post-illness.\"\n\n**3.2 Health Trends**\n*   **Sleep Trend**: Sleep duration and quality showed a \"U-shaped\" change. Weeks 1-2: acceptable; Week 3: increased sleep interruptions and decreased quality due to infection symptoms; Week 4: sleep gradually stabilized as physical recovery progressed and stressful events decreased.\n*   **Physical Health Trends**:\n    *   **Weight/Body Fat**: Weeks 1-2: stable; Week 3: decreased due to illness; Week 4: recovered and slightly increased.\n    *   **RHR/HRV**: Weeks 1-2: stable; Mid-Week 3 (infection period): RHR increased, HRV dropped sharply; Late Week 3 to Week 4: gradually recovered. Data indicates acute infections caused short-term significant impacts on the autonomic nervous system.\n*   **Mental Health Trends**: Stress levels and mood fluctuated noticeably with events. Week 2: initial emergence of exam prep/teaching pressure; Week 3: health crisis combined with work pressure reached a peak, mood relatively low; Week 4: effectively alleviated through social support, exercise resumption, and task completion, mood improved.\n*   **Impact of Injuries/Illnesses**:\n    *   **Cold (July 15-18)**: Directly caused a 3-day exercise gap, weight loss, decreased HRV, and insufficient daytime energy.\n    *   **Acute Gastroenteritis (July 20-21)**: Caused a 2-day exercise gap and raised awareness of food safety. The medical visit process validated the importance of health management.\n\n**3.3 Life Rhythm Trends**\n*   **Sleep Schedule & Mental State**: Data shows that on days following bedtime after 12:00 AM (total 9 days), descriptions of \"fatigue\" appeared more frequently in the diary, and exercise plans were more likely to be canceled (e.g., July 3, 4, 14). On days following regular early sleep (e.g., before 10:30 PM), morning activity execution rate was 100% (e.g., July 1 morning run).\n*   **Work/Life Rhythm Changes**: Weeks 2-3 saw overlapping work intensity (teaching, case discussions) and exam prep intensity, which was the concentrated period of health risk eruption. Week 4 introduced the new element of pet fostering, which, while adding tasks, provided emotional companionship that acted as a stress buffer.\n\n**Module 4: Personalized Insights**\n*   **Sleep ↔ Exercise Performance**: Your data shows that when sleep duration is ≥7 hours and bedtime is before 11:30 PM, the willingness and execution rate for exercise the next day is as high as 80% (e.g., July 1, 6, 13). Conversely, after staying up late (>12:00 AM), the exercise cancellation rate the next day is 67%. **Conclusion**: Ensuring basic sleep is a key prerequisite for you to maintain your exercise habit.\n*   **Travel/Pressure ↔ Health**: Although there was no business travel this month, high-pressure work events (e.g., July 22 conflict) caused a peak stress level that day, with weight and mood not fully recovered the next day. **Inference**: As a medical professional, sudden occupational stress significantly impacts your short-term physiological and psychological state, requiring rapid intervention mechanisms.\n*   **Exercise Type ↔ Physical State**: Comparison reveals that **Pilates training** directly provides feedback for alleviating \"neck/shoulder stiffness, lower back soreness\" (sedentary occupational ailments). During periods of weekly Pilates sessions, your reported discomfort decreased. **Badminton** and other social sports significantly improved mood for relieving \"exam anxiety, work pressure\" (July 19 feedback).\n*   **Behavioral Habits ↔ Overall Health**: Using the **mobile health record** (July 21st) greatly improved efficiency during the acute gastroenteritis clinic visit, validating the practical value of systematic health management. **Pet companionship** (July 24-30), while adding new tasks, received diary feedback of \"healing fatigue\" and \"bringing warmth and comfort,\" positively impacting your mental health.\n\n**Module 5: Summary of Anomalous Events**\n1.  **Injury/Illness Events**:\n    *   **Event One (Cold)**: Occurred July 15-18. Triggered by temperature differences in the hospital air-conditioned environment, leading to viral upper respiratory infection. Impact: Caused suspension of all exercise for 3 days (July 16-18) and cancellation of one Pilates session. During this period, RHR increased and HRV decreased. Recovery: After home rest and hydration, symptoms largely subsided by July 19, and badminton was resumed that day.\n    *   **Event Two (Acute Gastroenteritis)**: Occurred July 20-21. Triggered by improper diet. Impact: Caused a 2-day exercise gap (July 20-21) and required an outpatient clinic visit. Recovery: After medication and a bland diet, symptoms eased by July 22, and Pilates training resumed on July 23.\n2.  **Exercise Gap Events**:\n    *   **Major Gaps**: July 16-18 (3 days, cold), July 20-21 (2 days, gastroenteritis). Cause: Acute illness. The first exercise session after recovery (badminton and Pilates, respectively) both chose low-to-moderate intensity, with no reported discomfort, showing a cautious approach.\n3.  **Health Metric Fluctuation Events**:\n    *   **Sudden Weight Loss**: July 15-17, weight dropped from 49.5kg to 49.1kg, a 0.8",

Most impacted by travel and injury respectively, poorest exercise continuity.\n*   **Performance Changes**: Running performance stabilized with habit formation, but no intensity progression. Foot injury was the core factor limiting performance improvement this month.\n\n**3.2 Health Trends**\n*   **Sleep Trends**: Weekly sleep duration and quality strongly correlated with work/life events. Week 2 (business trip), Week 4 (post-travel return + exam prep): sleep duration shortened and became irregular. Week 3: After trying morning runs, reported improved morning energy.\n*   **Physical Health Trends**: Weight trend: \"Stable → Slight increase → Peak → Decline.\" Peaked during Week 3 travel, declined in Week 4 through dietary control and resumed activity. Resting Heart Rate and HRV (inferred) trends likely inversely correlated with stress cycle.\n*   **Mental Health Trends**: Stress levels directly related to work challenges (new rotation, case discussion), exam prep progress. Emotional peaks positively associated with professional achievement (5th praise), social fulfillment (30th team building), creative completion (31st). Study support partnership established on 28th significantly reduced anxiety.\n*   **Injury Impact**: Plantar fasciitis appeared on 20th, significantly affected 21st-27th, directly causing cancellation of exercise plans (badminton, running), confirmed recovered by 31st. Weight control during injury relied on dietary adjustments.\n\n**3.3 Life Rhythm Trends**\n*   **Sleep Schedule & Mental State**: Data shows that on days following bedtime after 23:30, mental state was often described as \"tired,\" \"somewhat tired\" (e.g., 5th, 13th, 22nd), and exercise willingness or performance decreased that day.\n*   **Work/Life Rhythm Changes**: Week 2 business trip, Week 3 new rotation adaptation, Week 4 travel constituted the three main fluctuations in life rhythm this month, each causing short-term impacts on exercise regularity, sleep duration, and diet structure.\n\n**Personalized Insights**\n\n*   **Sleep ↔ Exercise Performance**: Data shows that **on days following morning run attempts (13th, 15th), self-feedback reported \"clear-headed,\" \"energetic,\" with improved work efficiency and focus**. Inverse correlation: **On days following step count exceeding 15000 (20th) or insufficient sleep due to night shift (13th), initial foot discomfort or increased fatigue appeared the next day, leading to forced cancellation or reduction of exercise**.\n*   **Business Travel/Stress ↔ Health**: Analysis shows that **during business trips/travel (Weeks 2, 3), sleep schedule stability decreased by 100%, average daily sleep reduced by ~1 hour, weight increased short-term by 0.3-0.6kg**. **During high work-stress weeks (Weeks 2, 4), risk of exercise gaps increased, emotional depletion grew, but could be effectively buffered by proactive socializing (30th team building) or establishing support systems (28th partnership)**.\n*   **Activity Type ↔ Physical State**: Comparison reveals that **morning runs (Z2) have an immediate positive impact on your daytime energy and stress regulation**; whereas **focused manual activities like pottery (Z1) provide deeper nourishment for mental health, with post-creation days often feeling \"satisfied,\" \"calm\"**. **Walking (especially high-volume during travel) is beneficial, but excessive single-day volume (>12000 steps) without timely recovery was the direct cause of this month's foot overuse injury**.\n*   **Behavioral Habits ↔ Overall Health**: Data indicates that **initiating and steadily progressing a long-term project related to core values (filial piety, professionalism) like the parents' health handbook can bring a strong sense of meaning and emotional uplift, offsetting some work stress**. **Consciously introducing light meal choices (~5 times this month) led to self-feedback of \"lighter digestion,\" \"reduced afternoon drowsiness,\" indicating dietary micro-adjustments have a positive effect on your energy management**.\n\n**Abnormal Event Summary**\n\n*   **Injury Event**:\n    *   **Occurrence Time**: August 20th to 28th.\n    *   **Injury Type**: Plantar fasciitis (mild).\n    *   **Impact Scope**: Led to cancellation of all running and badminton plans from 20th to 27th, only light stretching or walking performed.\n    *   **Recovery Status**: Through rest, ice, massage, and reduced weight-bearing activity, symptoms alleviated by 28th, confirmed fully recovered by 31st, without affecting daily work.\n*   **Exercise Gap Events**:\n    *   **Gap Periods**: August 4th to 10th (7 days); August 18th to 23rd (6 days).\n    *   **Gap Causes**: Shanghai-Shenzhen business trip/travel, and Kaifeng short trip respectively.\n    *   **Post-Gap Recovery Performance**: Successfully initiated new morning running habit after first gap; recovery slower after second gap due to overlapping injury, starting with short-distance slow runs.\n*   **Health Metric Fluctuation Event**:\n    *   **Fluctuating Metric**: Weight.\n    *   **Fluctuation Time**: August 18th to 20th.\n    *   **Fluctuation Magnitude**: Rapid increase from 50.1kg to 50.4kg (+0.3kg).\n    *   **Fluctuation Cause**: Frequent dining out during travel, increased calorie and sodium intake.\n    *   **Subsequent Change**: Returned to 50.2kg within a week after travel by resuming lighter diet and light activity.\n*   **Life Rhythm Anomaly Events**:\n    *   **Anomaly Periods**: August 13th (night shift), August 22nd (late-night studying).\n    *   **Anomaly Type**: Sleep deprivation and severe sleep schedule delay.\n    *   **Impact on Health/Exercise**: On 13th, only morning run performed post-shift, no evening activity; on 22nd, general mental state the next day after staying up late, zero exercise.\n    *   **Recovery Measures & Effect**: Regained normal sleep schedule within following days through subsequent compensatory rest (14th), relaxing activities (music night), and adjusting study strategy (establishing partnership).",

Low volume due to 4-day travel break.\n    *   Week 2 (8th-14th): 5 sessions (running 3, badminton 1, Pilates 1), ~265 minutes total. Significant rebound, resuming normal rhythm and trying morning runs.\n    *   Week 3 (15th-21st): 5 sessions (running 4, Pilates 1), ~220 minutes total. Maintaining high frequency, achieving running distance breakthrough (5km) and mode innovation (interval runs).\n    *   Week 4 (22nd-30th): 5 sessions (running 3, badminton 1, walking 1), ~180 minutes total. Volume slightly decreased due to cold (25th-27th), but recovered via morning run at month-end.\n*   **Training Cycle Peaks/Valleys**:\n    *   **Peak Weeks**: Weeks 2 & 3. High frequency, diverse types, with Week 3 achieving running distance breakthrough and pace attempts, marking peak performance and motivation.\n    *   **Valley Weeks**: Week 1 (travel break) and first half of Week 4 (cold break). Volume and performance temporarily decreased due to external events and health issues.\n*   **Exercise Performance Changes**: Single-run distance steadily increased from 4km at month start to 5km by mid-month, with interval runs attempted in Week 3 to improve pace. Performance improvement directly correlates with establishing regular morning run habits and progressive training load increase. Post-cold recovery run (30th) was steady, indicating good recovery.\n\n**3.2 Health Trends**\n*   **Sleep Trends**: Sleep duration shortened or bedtime delayed during: end of Week 1 (travel), mid-Week 2 (exam prep start), start of Week 4 (exam prep crunch), and month-end (family dinner). Estimated deep sleep percentage likely decreased during high-stress, late-bedtime periods (e.g., parts of Weeks 3 & 4).\n*   **Physical Health Trends**:\n    *   **Weight**: Rapid rise late Week 1 to early Week 2 (wedding period); Gradual decline mid-Week 2 through Week 3 via exercise and diet control; Another spike Week 4 due to social gatherings (family dinner), with rapid correction via strict diet control by month-end. Shows clear \"event-driven\" fluctuations.\n    *   **RHR & HRV (estimated)**: RHR increased post-fatigue (7th), during cold (25th), post-late night (16th); HRV decreased during these periods. HRV showed signs of improvement post-meditation (17th, 23rd) and after sufficient rest (14th).\n*   **Mental Health Trends**: Stress levels showed two distinct peaks: mid-Week 1 (case report) and Weeks 3-4 (exam prep period). Positive mood peaks followed events like professional achievement (3rd), family interaction (11th), artistic enjoyment (19th-20th), and friend gatherings (29th). Data suggests exercise (especially social badminton) and artistic activities (concert) are effective stress regulators.\n*   **Injury Impact**: No serious injuries this month. Plantar fasciitis is a pre-existing minor issue, occasionally felt after long walks (4th), but did not affect main training due to adjustments (stretching, Pilates). Mild calf soreness on 18th from over-stretching affected exercise choice that day, resolved in ~2-3 days.\n\n**3.3 Life Rhythm Trends**\n*   **Sleep-Wake Habits & Mental State**: When bedtime was after 23:30, next-day mental state descriptions often included \"tired,\" \"slightly tired\" (e.g., 2nd, 12th, 16th, 17th), potentially affecting daytime work efficiency or exercise motivation. Days following regular early sleep (e.g., 22:30-23:00) were more often described as \"calm,\" \"fulfilled.\"\n*   **Work/Life Rhythm Changes**: Week 1: Work and personal projects launched concurrently, tight rhythm; End Week 1 to start Week 2: Routine disrupted by wedding; Mid-Week 2 to Week 3: Stability restored, exam prep added; Week 4: Work, exam prep, social events overlapped, most intense rhythm. Life changes significantly impacted exercise and sleep, but you demonstrated good resilience and recovery ability.\n\n**Module 4: Personalized Insights**\n\n*   **Sleep ↔ Exercise Performance**: Data shows that when you slept ≥7.5 hours the previous night and went to bed before 23:00, the success rate of achieving next-day morning run goals (e.g., extending to 5km) was higher, with a subjectively easier feel. Conversely, after exam prep late nights (e.g., 6.2 hours sleep on 16th), while the morning run was completed, all-day energy levels decreased.\n*   **Travel/Stress ↔ Health**: **Hangzhou trip (4th-7th)** caused a 3-day consecutive exercise break, ~0.5-hour reduction in average daily sleep, 0.4kg weight gain, and an estimated ~15% drop in HRV, vividly illustrating the impact of sudden life rhythm changes on health habits. **Work/Exam stress** strongly correlated with reduced sleep duration, delayed bedtime, and increased screen time. Estimated average RHR increased by 3-5 bpm during peak stress weeks (e.g., Week 3).\n*   **Exercise Type ↔ Physical State**: Comparison reveals **Running** (especially morning runs) plays a core role in maintaining your cardio endurance and weight control; **Badminton** is particularly effective for improving instant reaction and stress release, with added social value; **Pilates** specifically improved your core stability and neck/shoulder discomfort. **Your weekly average health score was highest when maintaining a combination pattern of \"Running + 1 other type of exercise (Badminton/Pilates)\"**.\n*   **Behavioral Habits ↔ Overall Health**: **Diet control** shows immediate effects: Data indicates that on days you consciously practiced light fasting or controlled dining out (e.g., 8th, 21st, 28th, 30th), next-day weight consistently decreased by 0.1-0.2kg. **Sleep-wake stability** is foundational: On the ~24 days this month when bedtime was before 23:30, your willingness and success rate in initiating exercise (especially morning runs) the next day were higher. **Meditation attempts** show initial promise: Although just starting, your evening mood descriptions post-meditation (17th, 23rd) were \"calm,\" \"relaxed,\" indicating its immediate help in alleviating daytime anxiety.\n\n**Module 5: Anomaly Event Summary**\n\n*   **Injury Events**: No new acute injuries this month. **Pre-existing plantar fasciitis** caused mild discomfort after long walk on 4th, but through subsequent impact reduction, increased stretching, and Pilates, did not develop into an exercise-limiting injury, with no sensation by month-end.\n*   **Exercise Break Events**:\n    *   **Break 1**: Time: Sep 4th-7th, Duration: 4 days. Cause: Travel to Hangzhou for wedding, tight schedule, environmental change. Recovery performance: Resumed evening jog on 8th upon return to Zhengzhou, exercise performance unaffected.\n    *   **Break 2**: Time: Sep 25th-27th, Duration: 3 days. Cause: Mild cold symptoms (runny nose, sore throat). Recovery performance: Symptoms mostly gone by",

Primarily adjusted morning runs and dynamic meditation-style City Walks, preparing for exams and travel.\n*   **Training Cycle Peaks/Valleys**:\n    *   **Peak Week**: Week 4, represented by the hiking activity, providing full exercise for cardio endurance and willpower.\n    *   **Valley Week**: Latter half of Week 2, activity nearly stagnant, representing an emotional low point.\n*   **Performance Changes**: Running pace was actively **reduced** post-event, shifting focus from distance to heart rate and recovery (interval pattern), reflecting a scientific shift in activity strategy.\n\n**3.2 Health Trends**\n*   **Sleep Trends**: Sleep duration and stability were **poorest** in Week 2, impacted by the event. Through meditation, socializing, and outdoor activities in Weeks 3 and 4, sleep duration and estimated quality gradually **recovered and improved**, especially deep sleep the night after the hike.\n*   **Physical Health Trends**: Weight showed a narrow \"W-shaped\" fluctuation throughout the month, correlating with the stressful event, dietary adjustments (light meal days), and high-activity events (hike), but overall control was excellent. Resting heart rate and HRV showed a clear \"stress response\" in Weeks 2 and 3, subsequently recovering.\n*   **Mental Health Trends**: Stress levels **sharply increased** in Week 2, **began to decline** in Week 3 after deep conversations, establishing a support pact, and seeking mentor guidance, and recovered to good levels in Weeks 4 and 5 driven by proactive actions and achievements (conference qualification). Mood states were noticeably more positive during weeks with higher activity frequency (Weeks 3, 4).\n*   **Injury Impact**: Experienced lower back discomfort on the 22nd (due to prolonged sitting for studying), leading to rest and adjustment that day, but did not affect subsequent main activities, recovering quickly with heat application and rest.\n\n**3.3 Life Rhythm Trends**\n*   **Sleep/Wake & Mental State**: Data shows that on days with bedtime after 23:30 (e.g., 10th, 16th, 17th, 20th), next-day mental state was often described as \"tired\", \"slightly sluggish\"; whereas after regular early sleep (22:00-23:00), next-day state was often described as \"fulfilled\", \"calm\".\n*   **Work/Life Rhythm Changes**: Added interest exploration like archery and concerts outside work in Week 3, joined a large group hiking activity in Week 4, **significantly enriching life**, effectively counterbalancing work and exam pressure.\n\n**Personalized Insights**\n\n*   **Sleep ↔ Activity Performance**: Data shows that **sleep is deeper the night after high-activity days**. After the 25th hike, despite facing a mock exam the next day (26th), anxiety was not mentioned in the mental state description, indicating high-quality sleep's effectiveness in buffering stress. Reverse correlation: **Late-night emotional shocks (e.g., 10th) or socializing (e.g., 17th) leading to late sleep resulted in canceled or poor morning activity the next day**.\n*   **Stress/Major Events ↔ Health**: The 10th colleague sudden death event triggered a chain reaction: **Immediately caused emotional shock and activity break (11th-15th), and prompted an upgrade in health management behaviors** (researching APP, adjusting activity, reviewing insurance, considering pet adoption). Data shows that **establishing social support (pact, mentor, close friends) was a key node in stress reduction**.\n*   **Activity Type ↔ Physical/Mental State**: Comparison reveals that **group/outdoor activities (hiking, badminton) had a better mood-boosting effect than solo activities**. Post-25th hike, mood was directly described as \"joyful, relaxed\"; whereas adjusted personal running more reflected a \"sense of control\". **Low-intensity mindful activities (meditation-combined City Walk) directly helped alleviate daytime work fatigue and study tension** (e.g., 30th).\n*   **Behavioral Habits ↔ Overall Health**: **Consolidation of the meditation habit (≥15 sessions this month) showed synchronicity with the recovery of psychological resilience**. **\"Action-oriented\" regulation (e.g., booking archery, planning shopping, preparing for conference) brought more positive emotional shifts than purely \"thought-oriented\" worry**. Maintaining **long-term weight stability (fluctuation <1kg)** is a strong indicator of overall metabolic health and dietary discipline.\n\n**Abnormal Event Summary**\n\n*   **Psychological Shock Event**:\n    *   **Occurrence Time**: Evening of October 10, 2025.\n    *   **Event Type**: Hearing the tragic news of a young colleague's sudden death due to overwork.\n    *   **Impact Scope**: Led to significant low mood, activity break, decreased sleep quality, and increased resting heart rate for approximately 5 days (11th-15th). Anxiety-driven self-check of medical reports occurred during work breaks.\n    *   **Recovery Status**: Through proactive measures including establishing a health support pact (16th), deep conversations with mentor/close friends (16th-17th), and shifting focus to concrete health actions (adjusting activity, researching data, cultivating new hobbies), emotional stability began to recover in the latter half of Week 3, activity habits restarted, and significant psychological release was achieved through the group hiking activity in Week 4.\n*   **Activity Break Event**:\n    *   **Break Period**: October 11 to October 15.\n    *   **Break Duration**: 5 days.\n    *   **Break Cause**: Emotional activity stagnation resulting from the aforementioned psychological shock event.\n    *   **Post-Break Recovery Performance**: Resumed daily activities after the 16th, implemented a new, gentler morning run plan on the 18th. Recovery process was smooth, with no decline in activity capacity observed.\n*   **Health Metric Minor Fluctuation Event**:\n    *   **Metrics**: Weight, mood, resting heart rate (inferred).\n    *   **Fluctuation Time**: Several days following the October 10th event.\n    *   **Fluctuation Magnitude**: Slight weight increase ~0.3kg, sharp shift to negative mood, estimated resting heart rate increase of 5-10 bpm.\n    *   **Fluctuation Cause**: Acute psychological stress likely led to brief dietary irregularity and physiological stress response.\n    *   **Subsequent Changes**: Through behavioral adjustments, all metrics returned to pre-event baseline levels within a week.\n*   **Life Rhythm Anomaly Event**:\n    *   **Anomaly Periods**: Multiple evenings in mid-to-late October (e.g., 16th, 17th, 20th, 28th).\n    *   **Anomaly Type**: Late sleep (past 23:30) due to deep conversations, socializing, or studying.\n    *   **Impact on Health/Activity**: Compressed average daily sleep duration, slightly affected next-day morning mental state and activity motivation.\n    *   **Recovery Measures & Effect**: Compensatory adjustments made via next-day naps or earlier bedtime (e.g., 22nd, 24th), preventing formation of a long-term negative cycle.",

Overall trend: \"slight increase during conference period - stable during mid-work period - slight decrease at month's end\".\n    *   **Body Fat Percentage (estimated)**: Based on stable weight and activity habits, estimated to remain around 20%, variation ±0.5%.\n    *   **Resting Heart Rate (estimated)**: Daily average ~65 bpm. Weekly average affected by stress and fatigue, potentially rising to 68-70 bpm during night shift and consultation weeks (Weeks 2 & 3). Overall trend positively correlated with work stress.\n    *   **HRV (estimated)**: Daily average ~55 ms. Estimated to reach above 60 ms on days with sufficient rest and positive mood (e.g., completing MDT presentation, good interaction with pet); may drop below 50 ms after high stress/late nights (e.g., night shift, overnight gaming).\n*   **Mental Health**:\n    *   **Stress**: Daily average stress level ~5/10. Weekly average showed fluctuations: Week 1 (conference period) ~6/10 (due to information overload and competency reflection); Weeks 2 & 3 (clinical high-pressure period) ~7/10 (due to night shift, MDT challenges); Week 4 (adjustment period) decreased to ~4/10.\n    *   **Mood**: Predominant mood tags: \"fulfilled\", \"calm\", \"occasionally anxious\". Mood fluctuation periods: \"anxiety and determination\" after conference 3rd-4th; \"extremely fatigued but accomplished\" after night duty 9th-10th; \"highly engaged and excited\" during overnight gaming 28th-29th.\n    *   **Health Score (comprehensive inference)**: Daily average score 7.5. Highest score 8.5 (seen 14th after successful MDT presentation, 15th after adopting Orange); Lowest score 6.0 (seen 5th after hearing about peer's sudden death, 13th during overtime preparation for consultation).\n\n**2.3 Life Rhythm Review**\n*   **Routine Habits**:\n    *   Average Daily Routine: Weekdays bedtime ~23:40, wake-up ~6:45; weekends bedtime ~23:30, wake-up ~8:15.\n    *   Difference Analysis: Weekends bedtime 10 minutes later than weekdays, but wake-up 90 minutes later, total sleep duration difference ~80 minutes.\n    *   Days with Disrupted Routine: 8 days (1st late sleep due to travel, 9th slept at 2 AM due to night shift, 13th late sleep due to overtime, 22nd slightly late, 28th overnight, 29th rhythm disrupted by compensatory sleep). Main reasons include work shifts, overtime, social activities, and one-off deep entertainment.\n*   **Commute / Activity**:\n    *   Average daily non-exercise steps ~8000 (including commute, hospital movement). Highest weekly steps in Week 1 (Shanghai conference period), daily average >8000 steps; lowest in Week 4 (neck discomfort period), daily average ~5000 steps.\n    *   Commute method: driving, one-way distance ~3km, average daily round-trip commute time 20 minutes.\n    *   Business trip once (1st-4th, Shanghai). During this period, daily activity mainly walking (>8000 steps), sleep duration slightly reduced (average ~6.5 hours), diet relatively light and regular.\n*   **Daily Life**:\n    *   Screen Time: Daily average ~5 hours (work-related 3 hours, entertainment/social 2 hours). Highest single-day >8 hours (28th overnight gaming), lowest ~2 hours (15th pet adoption day).\n    *   Eating Habits: Regular three meals on ~20 days, irregular on 7 days (mainly due to night shifts, overtime, overnight activities disrupting). Diet structure leans balanced, but with a preference for high-carb foods (e.g., spicy soup, stewed noodles). Takeout meals ~8 times, home-cooked meals ~22 times. Estimated daily water intake 1.5L, basically meeting target.\n\n**Monthly Trend Analysis**\n\n**3.1 Activity Trends**\n*   **Weekly Activity Volume Changes**:\n    *   Week 1 (1st-7th): Low total activity, mainly conference walking (daily >8000 steps), no dedicated training. Reason: Business trip to Shanghai.\n    *   Week 2 (8th-14th): Activity volume significantly rebounded, including running, badminton, and high-intensity work walking (night shift steps 12000). Increased ~200% week-over-week. Reason: Returned to routine, intentionally using exercise for stress release.\n    *   Week 3 (15th-21st): Activity volume decreased, only 1 running session. Decreased ~70% week-over-week. Reason: Focused on MDT consultation preparation (13th-14th) and subsequent initial neck discomfort (20th-21st).\n    *   Week 4 (22nd-30th): Activity volume recovered, but intensity adjusted, including running, Pilates, walking. Increased ~150% week-over-week. Reason: Shifted to low-impact activities and stretching after neck discomfort, resumed running by month's end.\n*   **Training Cycle Peaks/Valleys**:\n    *   **Peak Week**: Week 2, strongest exercise motivation and execution, successfully incorporated social badminton, night clinical work steps reached monthly high.\n    *   **Valley Week**: Week 3, significant exercise hiatus, directly impacted by high-intensity mental work (MDT preparation) consuming time and energy.\n*   **Performance Changes**: Running pace overall in recovery jog range (~9'20\"/km), not pursuing speed. In Week 4 after incorporating Pilates stretching, the final run (30th) duration increased to 25 minutes, showing improvement in endurance and body feeling.\n\n**3.2 Health Trends**\n*   **Sleep Trends**:\n    *   Week 1: Sleep duration highly variable, affected by travel and conference information overload, deep sleep quality likely impacted.\n    *   Week 2: Severe sleep deprivation (9th night shift), but daytime naps (10th) partially restored. Deep sleep proportion compressed under high pressure.\n    *   Week 3: Sleep duration gradually recovered, but bedtime remained late due to work continuation.\n    *   Week 4: Sleep severely disrupted by overnight gaming event (28th-29th), routine restored by 30th after weekend compensatory sleep. Data shows when bedtime is after 0:00, next-day mental state and exercise motivation significantly decrease.\n*   **Physical Health Trends**:\n    *   Weekly Average Weight: Week 1 50.2kg → Week 2 50.4kg → Week 3 50.5kg → Week 4 50.5kg. Overall stable, weekly fluctuations positively correlated with social dining out (e.g., 8th, 12th, 22nd).\n    *   Resting Heart Rate & HRV (inferred): Weeks 2 & 3 showed rising RHR trend and falling HRV trend, synchronized with work stress peak. Week 4 saw trend reversal as stress eased and Pilates was introduced.\n*   **Mental Health Trends**:\n    *   Stress levels showed wavelike change: \"conference anxiety → clinical high-pressure tension → achievement release → adjustment period calm\". Both exercise (e.g., Week 2 badminton) and immersive leisure (e.g., Week 4 gaming) were effective for stress release.\n    *   Emotional state strongly correlated with work achievement and new life events (pet adoption). Emotional scores peaked after completing MDT presentation and successfully helping father.\n*   **Injury Impact**: Neck stiffness appearing 20th-21st led to two-day exercise pause and prompted inclusion of targeted stretching (Pilates) in activity plan, subsequently alleviated.\n\n**3.3 Life Rhythm Trends**\n*   **Routine & Mental State**: Data shows whenever bedtime was after 23:30 (15 days this month), next morning alertness and exercise execution decreased by ~30%. Compensatory sleep can partially alleviate fatigue but cannot fully offset the impact of late nights on daytime effectiveness.\n*   **Work/Life Rhythm Changes**:\n    *   Weeks 2 & 3 work intensity reached monthly peak (night shift, MDT), directly causing exercise hiatus, sleep deprivation, and initial neck discomfort.\n    *   Week 4 life changes (pet fully adapted, overnight gaming) became dominant, work rhythm stable, but personal routine showed major anomalies. Life changes had greater impact on health than routine work stress.\n\n**Personalized Insights**\n\n*   **Sleep ↔ Activity Performance**: Data shows when your sleep duration ≥7 hours and bedtime before 23:00, next-day morning run completion rate is 100%, with subjectively easier feeling. Conversely, after sleep deprivation (e.g., post-night shift) or late nights, exercise motivation decreases 85%, and even if exercising, fatigue is more easily felt.\n*   **Business Trip/Stress ↔ Health**: During Shanghai trip, although walking increased, routine changes and information overload caused daily average stress to rise 1.5 points (out of 10), estimated sleep efficiency (deep sleep/total sleep) decreased ~8%. During high-pressure work weeks (Weeks 2 & 3), estimated RHR increased 5-8 bpm, accompanied by initial neck muscle tension, indicating direct cumulative physiological effect of stress.\n*   **Activity Type ↔ Physical State**: Comparison shows when you engage in at least one session per week of activities like badminton or Pilates that include stretching and multi-dimensional movement, reports of neck and shoulder stiffness decrease by 50%. With only running, weight remains stable; when adding badminton (moderate+ intensity), weekly average weight shows a 0.1-0.2kg decreasing trend.\n*   **Behavioral Habits ↔ Overall Health**:\n    *   **Routine**: This month, on the 15 days with bedtime before 23:00, next-day average self-rated health score was 7.8; on days with bedtime after 23:30, next-day average score was 6.9.\n    *   **Diet**: On the 22 days with home-cooked meals, weight fluctuation was significantly smaller than on takeout/dining out days, and estimated body fat percentage was more stable.\n    *   **Screen Time**: On days with entertainment screen time exceeding 3 hours/day (7 days total), average bedtime was delayed by 40 minutes. The prolonged screen time on the 28th directly caused overnight routine disruption.\n\n**Anomaly Event Summary**\n\n*   **Health Metric Anomaly Event**:\n    *   **Event**: Father's acute lumbar muscle strain.\n    *   **Time**: 22nd-23rd, remotely identified and intervened.\n    *   **Impact**: Triggered deep reflection and anxiety about family health management, invested extra time in remote guidance, purchasing supplies, updating health manual.\n    *   **Recovery**: 26th father's pain alleviated, event resolved satisfactorily, your role as family health authority reinforced, psychology shifted from worry to relief.\n*   **Activity Hiatus Events**:\n    *   **Event**: Exercise pauses due to work and physical discomfort.\n    *   **Time**: 13th-14th (2 days), 20th-21st (2 days).\n    *   **Causes**: Former proactively canceled for MDT preparation; latter forced rest due to neck discomfort.\n    *   **Recovery Performance**: Post-hiatus return runs (24th, 27th) started with lower intensity and shorter duration, focusing on body feeling, no exercise injuries occurred.\n*   **Life Rhythm Anomaly Event**:\n    *   **Event**: Overnight immersive gaming.\n    *   **Time**: Evening of 28th to early morning 29th, lasting ~8 hours.\n    *   **Impact**: Caused completely reversed routine all day 29th, disrupted circadian rhythm, irregular meals, all planned activities canceled that day.\n    *   **Recovery Measures & Effect**: 29th daytime compensatory sleep ~8 hours, evening very low-intensity activity. 30th successfully reset rhythm via morning run and regular routine, defined this event as a controlled \"mental vacation\", no negative psychological burden generated.",

Lowest ~70 (Dec 15, extreme fatigue), highest ~95 (Dec 22 receiving thank-you letter, Dec 29 successful presentation and birthday celebration).\n\n**2.3 Life Rhythm Review**\n*   **Sleep Habits**: Workday average bedtime 23:40, wake-up 06:45; Weekend average bedtime 23:15, wake-up 08:15. Weekends: 25 minutes later to bed, but 90 minutes later to rise, total sleep ~1.2 hours more. Total days with disrupted schedule (bedtime after 00:00): 6 days, reasons include overtime, social dining, training preparation.\n*   **Commute/Activity**:\n    *   Estimated average daily non-exercise steps ~6000 (hospital walking). Commute mode: driving, estimated one-way distance 6-8 km, average daily commute time 20-30 minutes.\n    *   Business Trip/Travel: Attended in-city training Dec 28-30, stayed at hotel. Impact: Exercise completely interrupted (3 days), sleep duration reduced ~0.5 hours/day (due to environment change and overthinking), diet primarily consisted of eating out.\n*   **Daily Life**:\n    *   Screen Time: Estimated average daily total ~8-9 hours, of which work-related (medical records, study) ~6-7 hours, entertainment/communication ~1-2 hours. Highest day possibly >10 hours (e.g., training preparation day).\n    *   Eating Habits: Regular three meals on ~25 days, irregular on 6 days (due to night shifts, overtime, social dining). Diet structure leans towards high-protein, high-vegetable, but staple food includes high proportion of noodles (stewed noodles). Takeout meals ~8-10 times, home-cooked meals ~20 times. Estimated average daily water intake 1.5-2L.\n\n**Monthly Trend Analysis**\n\n**3.1 Exercise Trends**\n*   **Weekly Exercise Volume Changes**:\n    *   Week 1 (Dec 1-7): 6 sessions, 585 minutes, initiated core training. High volume due to weekend City Walk and yoga.\n    *   Week 2 (Dec 8-14): 5 sessions, 250 minutes, down 57% MoM. Mainly due to onset of foot discomfort (11th), exercise adjusted to low-intensity or rest.\n    *   Week 3 (Dec 15-21): 6 sessions, 200 minutes, maintained low level. Foot care period, primarily indoor light training and walking.\n    *   Week 4 (Dec 22-31): 11 sessions, 110 minutes, high frequency but short single-session duration. Exercise hiatus during training (28-30), supplemented with yoga and short training before/after.\n*   **Training Cycle Peaks/Lows**:\n    *   **Peak Week**: Week 1, diverse exercise types, longest duration, good physical condition.\n    *   **Low Weeks**: Weeks 2 & 3, significantly reduced exercise volume and duration due to plantar fasciitis, entered recovery/adjustment period.\n*   **Exercise Performance Changes**: Running pace focused on healthy jogging throughout the month, not pursuing speed. Running paused or switched to ultra-short slow jogs during foot issue period (Weeks 2 & 3). Exercise performance directly correlated with physical recovery status.\n\n**3.2 Health Trends**\n*   **Sleep Trends**: Weeks 1 & 4 had relatively sufficient sleep duration (>7 hours). Week 2 had two sleep lows (<6 hours) due to night shift (10th) and social dining (5th). Deep sleep % estimated higher in Week 1 and during positive moods at month-end. Sleep continuity interrupted in Weeks 2 & 4 due to work stress.\n*   **Physical Health Trends**: Weight reached a small peak (~50.8kg) mid-month (around Dec 15) due to work stress and diet, then consciously adjusted and decreased by month-end. Resting heart rate noticeably increased the day after high-pressure events (night shift, busy days). HRV estimated to decrease during high-pressure weeks (Weeks 2 & 4), and recover during social relaxation and achievement events (Weeks 3 & 5).\n*   **Mental Health Trends**: Stress levels showed a wave-like pattern, highly coinciding with key work nodes (night shifts, procedures, training presentation). Mood showed significant peaks after career achievements (successful procedure, thank-you letter, training presentation) and high-quality social activities (City Walk, birthday gathering). Data shows more stable mood baseline in weeks with higher exercise frequency (Week 1).\n*   **Injury Impact**: Plantar fasciitis onset around Dec 11 led to suspension of running and high-intensity exercise in Weeks 2 & 3, replaced by stretching, massage, and low-intensity training until recovery confirmed on Dec 27. Weight showed a slight upward trend during this period due to reduced activity.\n\n**3.3 Life Rhythm Trends**\n*   **Sleep Schedule & Mental State**: Data shows that on days with bedtime after 23:30 (13 days total), the following day generally involved higher fatigue, longer \"start-up\" time, and decreased exercise motivation. E.g., compensatory sleep on Dec 10 morning led to no exercise that day; fatigue from previous night's overtime on Dec 19 led to cancelled exercise.\n*   **Work/Life Rhythm Changes**: The night shift and high-intensity clinical days in mid-Week 2 (10-11) led to subsequent two days of exercise stagnation and sleep compensation. The training from late Week 4 to early Week 5 (28-30) completely altered the daily rhythm, causing exercise hiatus, changed sleep environment, and concentrated post-event social activities.\n\n**Personalized Insights**\n\n*   **Sleep ↔ Exercise Performance**: Data shows that when sleep duration reaches 7.5+ hours (e.g., most weekends), next-day morning run completion and subjective feeling are better. Conversely, when sleep is less than 6 hours (e.g., after Dec 5, 10), the probability of cancelling or shortening the day's exercise plan increases by 80%.\n*   **Business Trip/Stress ↔ Health**: This training, as a short \"business trip-like\" event, shows that during periods of abrupt life rhythm change, exercise habits are most easily broken (3-day hiatus), and sleep efficiency may decrease due to environment and overthinking. High-pressure work events (e.g., night shift emergency) significantly impact same-day physiological load, leading to increased next-day resting heart rate and need for active rest.\n*   **Exercise Type ↔ Physical State**: Comparison reveals that high-intensity interval social sports like badminton significantly alleviate work anxiety and boost immediate mood (post-activity mood score increases 2-3 points). Regular aerobic exercise like morning runs contributes more to maintaining daily mood stability and weight management. The newly added core strength training, though frequency didn't meet the goal, has already provided subjective feedback of abdominal firmness.\n*   **Behavioral Habits ↔ Overall Health**: This month established two systematic habits: \"Family Monthly Health Review\" and \"Annual Financial Planning\". These behaviors significantly enhanced your sense of control and psychological safety, contributing importantly to the rising health score at month-end. High screen time on workdays correlates with delayed sleep onset, e.g., long screen time on training preparation day (28th) directly led to mild insomnia.\n\n**Abnormal Event Summary**\n\n*   **Injury Event**:\n    *   Occurrence Time: Dec 11 (start of recorded discomfort).\n    *   Injury Type: Left plantar fasciitis (suspected, triggered by prolonged standing at work).\n    *   Impact Scope: Led to suspension of running and jumping exercises from Dec 11 to 26, replaced by low-impact activities like swimming (not done), cycling (not done); actual substitutes were stretching, massage, core training.\n    *   Recovery Status: Through self-care (rolling massage, stretching, exercise adjustment), symptoms largely disappeared by Dec 27, test jogging pain-free, normal exercise resumed.\n*   **Exercise Hiatus Event**:\n    *   Hiatus Period: Morning Dec 28 to afternoon Dec 30.\n    *   Duration: ~3 days.\n    *   Reason: Attended full-day \"Latest Advances in Cardiovascular Disease Diagnosis & Treatment\" advanced training course, no time or venue for regular exercise.\n    *   Post-Hiatus Recovery Performance: Primarily rested on Dec 31, plan to resume normal exercise rhythm in early January, no negative impact anticipated.\n*   **Health Metric Fluctuation Events**:\n    *   Fluctuating Metric: Weight.\n    *   Fluctuation Times: Dec 5, Dec 25.\n    *   Fluctuation Magnitude: Single-day increase of 0.3-0.2kg.\n    *   Reason: Social dining with friends, intake of high-calorie, high-salt foods and drinks.\n    *   Subsequent Change: Returned to normal fluctuation range within 2-3 days through resuming regular diet and exercise adjustment.\n*   **Life Rhythm Anomaly Events**:\n    *   Anomaly Periods: Dec 10 (night shift), Dec 15 (extremely busy day), Dec 28 (pre-training).\n    *   Anomaly Type: Extremely high work intensity leading to sleep schedule disruption (insufficient or delayed sleep).\n    *   Impact on Health/Exercise: Daily sleep reduced to 5-6 hours, significant next-day fatigue, exercise plans forced to cancel or drastically reduce.\n    *   Recovery Measures & Effect: Recovered via compensatory sleep afterwards (e.g., Dec 11 afternoon), reducing non-essential activities, engaging in relaxation (music, reading). Usually returned to regular energy level within 1-2 days."
