**Module 3: Monthly Trend Analysis**

**3.1 Exercise Trends**
*   **Weekly Exercise Volume Changes**:
    *   Week 1 (1st-7th): 3 sessions (running 2x, walking 1x), ~100 min total. Lower volume due to 4-day travel break.
    *   Week 2 (8th-14th): 5 sessions (running 3x, badminton 1x, Pilates 1x), ~265 min total. Significant rebound, resuming normal rhythm and trying morning runs.
    *   Week 3 (15th-21st): 5 sessions (running 4x, Pilates 1x), ~220 min total. Maintaining high frequency, achieving running distance breakthrough (5km) and mode innovation (interval runs).
    *   Week 4 (22nd-30th): 5 sessions (running 3x, badminton 1x, walking 1x), ~180 min total. Volume slightly decreased due to cold (25th-27th), but recovered via morning run at month-end.
*   **Training Cycle Peaks/Valleys**:
    *   **Peak Weeks**: Weeks 2 & 3. High frequency, diverse types, achieving running distance breakthrough and pace attempts in Week 3, marking peak performance and motivation.
    *   **Valley Weeks**: Week 1 (travel break) and first half of Week 4 (cold break). Volume and performance temporarily decreased due to external events and health issues.
*   **Exercise Performance Changes**: Single running distance steadily increased from 4km early month to 5km mid-month, with interval run attempts in Week 3 to improve pace. Performance improvement directly correlates with established regular morning run habit and progressive training load increase. Post-cold recovery run (30th) performance was stable, indicating good recovery.

**3.2 Health Trends**
*   **Sleep Trends**: Sleep duration shortened or bedtime delayed during: end of Week 1 (travel), mid Week 2 (exam prep start), start of Week 4 (exam prep crunch), and month-end (family dinner). Estimated deep sleep percentage likely decreased during high-stress, late-bedtime periods (e.g., parts of Weeks 3 & 4).
*   **Physical Health Trends**:
    *   **Weight**: Rapid rise late Week 1 to early Week 2 (wedding); gradual decline mid Week 2 to Week 3 via exercise/diet control; another spike Week 4 due to social gathering (family dinner), with rapid correction via strict diet by month-end. Shows clear "event-driven" fluctuation pattern.
    *   **RHR & HRV (estimated)**: RHR increased post-fatigue (7th), during cold (25th), post-late night (16th); HRV decreased during these periods. Estimated HRV showed signs of improvement post-meditation (17th, 23rd) and after sufficient rest (14th).
*   **Mental Health Trends**: Stress levels showed two distinct peaks: mid Week 1 (case report) and Weeks 3-4 (exam prep period). Positive mood peaks followed events like professional achievement (3rd), family interaction (11th), artistic enjoyment (19th-20th), and friend gatherings (29th). Data suggests exercise (especially social badminton) and artistic activities (concert) were effective stress regulators.
*   **Injury Impact**: No serious injuries this month. Plantar fasciitis is a pre-existing minor issue, occasionally felt after prolonged walking (4th), but did not affect main training due to adjustments (stretching, Pilates). Mild calf soreness on 18th from over-stretching affected exercise choice that day, resolved in ~2-3 days.

**3.3 Life Rhythm Trends**
*   **Routine & Mental State**: When bedtime was after 23:30, next-day mental state descriptions often included "Tired", "Slightly tired" (e.g., 2nd, 12th, 16th, 17th), potentially affecting daytime work efficiency or exercise motivation. Days following regular early sleep (e.g., 22:30-23:00) were more often described as "Calm", "Fulfilled".
*   **Work/Life Rhythm Changes**: Week 1: work and personal projects launched concurrently, compact rhythm; Weekend Week 1 to early Week 2: routine disrupted by wedding; Mid Week 2 to Week 3: stability restored, exam prep added; Week 4: work, exam prep, social events overlapped, most intense rhythm. Life changes significantly impacted exercise and sleep, but you demonstrated good resilience and recovery ability.

**Module 4: Personalized Insights**

*   **Sleep ↔ Exercise Performance**: Data shows that when you slept ≥7.5 hours and went to bed before 23:00 the previous night, the success rate of achieving next-day morning run goals (e.g., extending to 5km) was higher, with a subjectively easier feel. Conversely, after exam prep late nights (e.g., 16th: 6.2 hours sleep), although the morning run was completed, overall energy levels decreased throughout the day.
*   **Travel/Stress ↔ Health**: **Hangzhou trip (4th-7th)** led to 3 consecutive days of exercise break, average daily sleep reduced by 0.5 hours, weight increased by 0.4kg, estimated HRV decreased ~15%, vividly illustrating the impact of sudden life rhythm changes on health habits. **Work/Exam stress** strongly correlated with shortened sleep duration, delayed bedtime, and increased screen time. Estimated average RHR increased by 3-5 bpm during peak stress weeks (e.g., Week 3).
*   **Exercise Type ↔ Physical State**: Comparison reveals: **Running** (especially morning runs) plays a core role in maintaining your cardiorespiratory endurance and weight control; **Badminton** is highly effective for improving instant reaction and stress release, with added social value; **Pilates** specifically improved your core stability and neck/shoulder discomfort. **Your weekly average health score was highest when maintaining a "Running + 1 other type (Badminton/Pilates)" combination pattern weekly**.
*   **Behavioral Habits ↔ Overall Health**: **Diet control** shows immediate effect: Data indicates that on days you consciously practiced light fasting or controlled dining out (e.g., 8th, 21st, 28th, 30th), next-day weight consistently decreased by 0.1-0.2kg. **Routine stability** is foundational: On ~24 days this month when bedtime was before 23:30, your willingness and completion rate for initiating exercise (especially morning runs) the next day were higher. **Meditation attempts** show initial promise: Although just starting, your evening mood descriptions post-meditation (17th, 23rd) were "Calm", "Relaxed", indicating its immediate help in alleviating daytime anxiety.

**Module 5: Anomaly Event Summary**

*   **Injury Events**: No new acute injuries this month. **Pre-existing plantar fasciitis** caused mild discomfort after prolonged walking on the 4th. Through subsequent reduction of impact, increased stretching, and Pilates training, it did not develop into an exercise-limiting injury and was unnoticeable by month-end.
*   **Exercise Break Events**:
    *   **Break 1**: Time: Sep 4th-7th, Duration: 4 days. Cause: Travel to Hangzhou for wedding, tight schedule and environmental change. Recovery performance: Resumed evening jog on 8th upon return to Zhengzhou, exercise performance unaffected.
    *   **Break 2**: Time: Sep 25th-27th, Duration: 3 days. Cause: Mild cold symptoms (runny nose,
