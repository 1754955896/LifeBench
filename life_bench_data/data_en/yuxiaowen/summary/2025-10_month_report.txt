**Monthly Trend Analysis**

**3.1 Activity Trends**
*   **Weekly Activity Volume**:
    *   **Week 1 (1st-6th)**: Low activity volume, mainly family walks. Due to holiday family interaction.
    *   **Week 2 (7th-13th)**: Activity volume normal initially then plummeted. Badminton before the 10th event, almost no dedicated activity after (11th-13th).
    *   **Week 3 (14th-20th)**: Activity volume **significantly rebounded**. Added archery experience and began adjusted morning run plan. Due to actively seeking stress relief and new balance.
    *   **Week 4 (21st-27th)**: Activity volume reached **peak**. Included major hiking activity and end-of-month running, highest duration and intensity. For stress release, fulfilling health pact.
    *   **Week 5 (28th-31st)**: Activity remained active. Mainly adjusted morning runs and dynamic meditation-style City Walks, preparing for exam and travel.
*   **Training Cycle Peaks/Valleys**:
    *   **Peak Week**: Week 4, represented by the hiking activity, fully exercising cardio endurance and willpower.
    *   **Valley Week**: Latter half of Week 2, activity nearly halted, an emotional low point.
*   **Performance Changes**: Running pace was actively **reduced** post-event, shifting from pursuing distance to focusing on heart rate and recovery (interval pattern), reflecting a scientific shift in exercise strategy.

**3.2 Health Trends**
*   **Sleep Trend**: Week 2 had the **poorest** sleep duration and stability, impacted by the event. Weeks 3 & 4 saw gradual **recovery and improvement** in sleep duration and estimated quality through meditation, socializing, outdoor activities, especially deep sleep the night after hiking.
*   **Physical Health Trend**: Weight showed a narrow "W-shaped" fluctuation throughout the month, linked to stressful events, dietary adjustments (light meal days), high-activity events (hiking), but overall control was excellent. Resting heart rate and HRV showed a clear "stress response" in Weeks 2 & 3, subsequently recovering.
*   **Mental Health Trend**: Stress levels **sharply climbed** in Week 2, **began to decline** in Week 3 after deep conversations, establishing a support pact, seeking mentor guidance, and recovered to good levels in Weeks 4 & 5 driven by proactive actions and achievement (conference qualification). Mood states were noticeably more positive during weeks with higher activity frequency (Weeks 3 & 4).
*   **Injury Impact**: Lower back discomfort occurred on the 22nd (due to prolonged sitting for study), leading to rest and adjustment that day, but did not affect subsequent major activities, recovering quickly with heat application and rest.

**3.3 Life Rhythm Trends**
*   **Sleep/Wake & Mental State**: Data shows that on days with bedtime after 23:30 (e.g., 10th, 16th, 17th, 20th), next-day mental state was often described as "tired", "slightly sluggish"; whereas after regular early sleep (22:00-23:00), next-day descriptions were often "fulfilled", "calm".
*   **Work/Life Rhythm Changes**: Week 3 added interest exploration like archery, concerts outside work; Week 4 added a large group hiking activity. **Life enrichment significantly increased**, effectively counterbalancing work and exam pressure.

**Personalized Insights**

*   **Sleep ↔ Activity Performance**: Data shows **deeper sleep follows days with high activity volume**. After the 25th hike, despite facing a mock exam the next day (26th), anxiety was not mentioned in the mental state description, indicating high-quality sleep effectively buffered stress. Inverse correlation: **Late-night emotional shocks (e.g., 10th) or socializing (e.g., 17th) leading to late sleep resulted in cancelled or poor morning activity the next day**.
*   **Stress/Major Events ↔ Health**: The 10th colleague's sudden death triggered a chain reaction: **Immediately caused emotional shock and activity break (11th-15th), and prompted an upgrade in health management behaviors** (researching APP, adjusting exercise, reviewing insurance, considering pet adoption). Data shows **establishing social support (pact, mentor, close friends) was the key node for stress reduction**.
*   **Activity Type ↔ Physical/Mental State**: Comparison reveals **group/outdoor activities (hiking, badminton) had a better mood-boosting effect than solo activities**. After the 25th hike, mood was directly described as "joyful, relaxed"; whereas adjusted solo running more reflected a "sense of control". **Low-intensity mindful activities (meditation-combined City Walk) directly alleviated daytime work fatigue and study tension** (e.g., 30th).
*   **Behavioral Habits ↔ Overall Health**: **Consolidation of the meditation habit (≥15 sessions this month) coincided with the recovery of psychological resilience**. **"Action-oriented" regulation (e.g., booking archery, planning shopping, preparing for conference) led to more positive emotional shifts than purely "contemplative" worry**. Maintaining **long-term stable weight (fluctuation <1kg)** is a strong indicator of overall metabolic health and dietary discipline.

**Abnormal Event Summary**

*   **Psychological Shock Event**:
    *   **Occurrence Time**: Evening of October 10, 2025.
    *   **Event Type**: Learning of the sudden death of a young colleague due to overwork.
    *   **Impact Scope**: Caused significant low mood, activity break, decreased sleep quality, increased resting heart rate for ~5 days (11th-15th). Anxious self-check of medical reports occurred during work breaks.
    *   **Recovery Status**: Through proactive measures including establishing a health support pact (16th), deep conversations with mentor/close friends (16th-17th), shifting focus to concrete health actions (adjusting exercise, researching data, cultivating new hobbies), emotional stability began recovering in the latter half of Week 3, activity habits restarted, and significant psychological release was achieved through the group hiking activity in Week 4.
*   **Activity Break Event**:
    *   **Break Period**: October 11 to October 15.
    *   **Break Duration**: 5 days.
    *   **Break Cause**: Emotional activity stagnation following the aforementioned psychological shock event.
