**Monthly Trend Analysis**

**3.1 Activity Trends**
*   **Weekly Activity Volume Changes**:
    *   **Week 1 (1st-3rd)**: Low activity, only 2 walks, in post-rotation adjustment period.
    *   **Week 2 (4th-10th)**: Activity nearly zero, completely interrupted by business trip and cross-city travel.
    *   **Week 3 (11th-17th)**: Activity rebounded significantly, attempted and completed 3 morning runs, peak activity week.
    *   **Week 4 (18th-31st)**: Activity first suppressed then rebounded. 18th-23rd interrupted again by travel and injury; 24th-31st injury recovery period, attempted short slow runs.
*   **Training Cycle Peaks/Lows**:
    *   **Peak Week**: Week 3. Successfully initiated morning run habit, strongest exercise motivation and execution.
    *   **Low Weeks**: Week 2 and first half of Week 4. Most affected by travel and injury respectively, poorest exercise consistency.
*   **Performance Changes**: Running performance stabilized with habit formation, but no intensity progression. Foot injury was the core factor limiting performance improvement this month.

**3.2 Health Trends**
*   **Sleep Trends**: Weekly sleep duration and quality strongly correlated with work/life events. Sleep duration shortened and became irregular in Week 2 (travel) and Week 4 (post-travel + exam prep). Positive feedback on morning energy after attempting morning runs in Week 3.
*   **Physical Health Trends**: Weight trend: "stable → slight increase → peak → decline." Peaked during travel in Week 3, declined in Week 4 through diet control and resumed activity. Resting Heart Rate and HRV (inferred) trends likely inversely correlated with stress cycles.
*   **Mental Health Trends**: Stress levels directly related to work challenges (new rotation, case discussion) and exam prep progress. Mood peaks positively associated with professional achievement (5th praise), social satisfaction (30th team building), creative completion (31st). Exam prep partnership established on 28th significantly reduced anxiety.
*   **Injury Impact**: Plantar fasciitis appeared on 20th, significantly affected 21st-27th, directly causing cancellation of exercise plans (badminton, running), confirmed recovered by 31st. Weight control during injury relied on dietary adjustments.

**3.3 Life Rhythm Trends**
*   **Sleep & Mental State**: Data shows that on days following bedtime after 23:30, mental state descriptions were mostly "tired," "slightly tired" (e.g., 5th, 13th, 22nd), and exercise motivation or performance decreased that day.
*   **Work/Life Rhythm Changes**: Work travel in Week 2, adaptation to new rotation in Week 3, and travel in Week 4 constituted the three main fluctuations in life rhythm this month, each causing short-term impacts on exercise regularity, sleep duration, and diet structure.

**Personalized Insights**

*   **Sleep ↔ Activity Performance**: Data shows that **on days following morning run attempts (13th, 15th), self-feedback indicated "clear-headed," "energetic," with improved work efficiency and focus**. Inverse correlation: **On days with step count exceeding 15000 (20th) or insufficient sleep after night shift (13th), initial foot discomfort or increased fatigue appeared the next day, forcing exercise cancellation or reduction**.
*   **Travel/Stress ↔ Health**: Analysis shows that **during business trips/travel (Weeks 2, 3), sleep schedule stability decreased 100%, average daily sleep reduced by ~1 hour, weight increased short-term by 0.3-0.6kg**. **During high work-stress weeks (Weeks 2, 4), risk of exercise gaps increased, emotional drain was greater, but could be effectively buffered by proactive socializing (30th team building) or establishing support systems (28th partnership)**.
*   **Activity Type ↔ Physical State**: Comparison reveals that **morning runs (Z2) have an immediate positive impact on your daytime energy and stress regulation**; whereas **focused manual activities like pottery (Z1) provide deeper nourishment for mental health, with post-creation days often feeling "satisfied," "calm"**. **Walking (especially high-volume during travel) is beneficial, but excessive single-day volume (>12000 steps) without timely recovery was the direct cause of this month's foot overuse injury**.
*   **Behavioral Habits ↔ Overall Health**: Data indicates that **initiating and steadily progressing a long-term project related to core values (filial piety, professionalism) like the parents' health handbook can bring a strong sense of meaning and emotional uplift, offsetting some work stress**. **Consciously introducing light meal choices (~5 times this month) led to self-feedback of "easier digestion," "reduced afternoon drowsiness," indicating dietary micro-adjustments have a positive effect on your energy management**.

**Abnormal Event Summary**
