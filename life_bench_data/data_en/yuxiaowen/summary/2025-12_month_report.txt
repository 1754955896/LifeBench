**Monthly Trend Analysis**

**3.1 Activity Trends**
*   **Weekly Activity Volume Changes**:
    *   Week 1 (Dec 1-7): 6 sessions, 585 minutes, initiated core training. High volume, includes weekend City Walk and yoga.
    *   Week 2 (Dec 8-14): 5 sessions, 250 minutes, down 57% month-over-month. Mainly due to onset of foot discomfort (11th), activity adjusted to low-intensity or rest.
    *   Week 3 (Dec 15-21): 6 sessions, 200 minutes, maintained low level. Foot care period, focused on indoor light training and walking.
    *   Week 4 (Dec 22-31): 11 sessions, 110 minutes, high frequency but short individual session duration. Exercise interrupted during training (28-30), supplemented with yoga and short training before/after.
*   **Training Cycle Peaks/Troughs**:
    *   **Peak Week**: Week 1, diverse activity types, longest duration, good physical condition.
    *   **Trough Weeks**: Weeks 2 & 3, significantly reduced activity volume and duration due to plantar fasciitis, entered recovery and adjustment period.
*   **Performance Changes**: Running pace focused on healthy jogging throughout the month, not pursuing speed. Running paused or switched to ultra-short slow jogs during foot issue period (Weeks 2 & 3). Performance directly correlated with physical recovery status.

**3.2 Health Trends**
*   **Sleep Trends**: Weeks 1 & 4 had relatively sufficient sleep (>7 hours). Week 2 showed two sleep troughs (<6 hours) due to night shift (10th) and social dining (5th). Estimated deep sleep percentage higher in Week 1 and during positive moods at month-end. Sleep continuity interrupted in Weeks 2 & 4 due to work stress.
*   **Physical Health Trends**: Weight showed a small peak (~50.8kg) around mid-month (Dec 15) due to work stress and diet, then consciously adjusted and decreased by month-end. Resting heart rate noticeably increased the day after high-pressure events (night shift, busy days). HRV estimated to decrease during high-pressure weeks (Weeks 2 & 4), and recover after social relaxation and achievement events (Weeks 3 & 5).
*   **Mental Health Trends**: Stress levels showed a wave-like pattern, highly coinciding with key work nodes (night shifts, procedures, training presentation). Mood showed significant peaks after professional achievements (successful procedure, thank-you letter, training presentation) and high-quality social interactions (City Walk, birthday gathering). Data shows more stable mood baseline in weeks with higher activity frequency (Week 1).
*   **Injury Impact**: Plantar fasciitis onset around Dec 11 led to pause of running and high-intensity activities in Weeks 2 & 3, replaced by stretching, massage, and low-intensity training until recovery confirmed on Dec 27. Weight showed slight upward trend during this period due to reduced activity.

**3.3 Life Rhythm Trends**
*   **Sleep Schedule & Mental State**: Data shows that on days with bedtime later than 23:30 (total 13 days), the following day generally accompanied higher fatigue, longer "start-up" time, and decreased exercise motivation. E.g., compensatory sleep on Dec 10 morning, no exercise that day; exercise canceled on Dec 19 due to fatigue from previous night's overtime.
*   **Work/Life Rhythm Changes**: The night shift and high-intensity clinical days in mid-Week 2 (10-11) led to two days of exercise stagnation and sleep compensation. The training from end of Week 4 to start of Week 5 (28-30) completely altered daily rhythm, causing exercise interruption, changed sleep environment, and concentrated social activities afterwards.

**Personalized Insights**

*   **Sleep ↔ Exercise Performance**: Data shows that when sleep duration reaches 7.5+ hours (e.g., most weekends), completion rate and subjective feeling of next-day morning runs are better. Conversely, when sleep is less than 6 hours (e.g., after Dec 5, 10), probability of canceling or shortening exercise plan that day increases by 80%.
*   **Business Trip/Stress ↔ Health**: This training, as a short "business trip-like" event, shows that during periods of abrupt life rhythm change, exercise habits are most easily broken (3-day interruption), and sleep efficiency may decrease due to environment and overthinking. High-pressure work events (e.g., night shift emergency) significantly impact physiological load on the day, leading to increased resting heart rate and need for active rest the next day.
*   **Activity Type ↔ Physical State**: Comparison reveals that high-intensity interval social sports like badminton significantly alleviate work anxiety and boost immediate mood (post-activity mood score increases 2-3 points). Regular aerobic exercises like morning runs contribute more to maintaining daily emotional stability and weight management. The newly added core strength training, although frequency didn't meet target, has already provided subjective feedback of abdominal tightness.
*   **Behavioral Habits ↔ Overall Health**: This month established two systematic habits: "Family Monthly Health Review" and "Annual Financial Planning". These behaviors significantly enhanced your sense of control and psychological safety, important contributing factors to the rising health score at month-end. High screen time on workdays correlates with delayed sleep onset, e.g., long screen time on training preparation day (28th) directly led to mild insomnia.
