The shop was quiet and peaceful, and the barista introduced him to the origin, processing methods, and flavor characteristics of the coffee beans. Yin Hao resonated with the pour-over process, which required precise control—from accurately weighing the beans and grinding them evenly to maintaining a steady pouring technique. This reminded him of the exacting demands for precision in parameters and movements when operating CNC machine tools. He tried his hand at it twice. Although the first attempt resulted in uneven extraction due to unstable water flow, his second attempt showed significant improvement under the barista’s guidance. The entire experience felt both novel and familiar to him."

In the morning, Yin Hao and Wang Lei redesigned and adjusted the workpiece fixture, adding auxiliary support points to ensure an even distribution of clamping force. In the afternoon, Liu Zhiqiang carefully fine-tuned the tool's approach path to the workpiece based on the new clamping scheme, avoiding excessive cutting force during the first pass. After the adjustments were completed, Yin Hao, with his extensive operational experience, personally conducted the second trial machining. Throughout the process, he remained highly focused, and after finishing each part, he immediately collaborated with the quality inspector to measure it using a coordinate measuring machine. The measurement data showed a significant improvement in accuracy, but there were still slight fluctuations between batches. Yin Hao believed that further observation and verification were needed to ensure stability."

Attached to the letter was a printed \"Guidelines for Accommodating Property Viewings,\" which stated that real estate agents would bring potential buyers to view the apartment during the sales period and required his cooperation. Yin Hao immediately contacted \"Sister Li\" via WeChat to confirm the matter. She replied, acknowledging the situation and expressing her apologies, but emphasized that the decision to sell the property was final. The sudden news left Yin Hao feeling as though his private space had been invaded and brought uncertainty to the next two months.
