### **Module 3: Monthly Trend Analysis**

#### **3.1 Activity Trends**
*   **Weekly Activity Volume Changes:**
    *   **Week 1 (Aug 1-3):** Initiated peak training, running volume ~40 km, including interval run.
    *   **Week 2 (Aug 4-10):** Peak training volume, running ~65 km, completed key 18km long run. Increased 62.5% vs. previous week, per training plan.
    *   **Week 3 (Aug 11-17):** Maintained peak and final push, running ~60 km, completed ultimate 30km long run. Athletic performance peaked.
    *   **Week 4 (Aug 18-24):** Entered taper phase, running volume sharply decreased to ~25 km, down 58.3% vs. previous week, aimed at promoting recovery.
    *   **Week 5 (Aug 25-31):** Pre-race adjustment and race week, running ~50 km (including half marathon), intensity decreased then increased.
*   **Training Cycle Peaks/Lows:**
    *   **Peak Week:** Week 3 (Aug 11-17). Performance evidenced by successful completion of 30km long run with stable pace, physical tolerance reached peak.
    *   **Low Week:** No significant performance low. Week 4 was planned taper, not performance decline.
*   **Performance Changes:** Running average pace improved from ~5'35"/km in Week 1 to 5'05"/km in Week 3 simulation run, and speed sensation was maintained during taper (Weeks 4 & 5) via short pace runs. Pace improvement directly correlated with periodized training load and physical adaptation.

#### **3.2 Health Trends**
*   **Sleep Trends:** Weeks 2 & 3, despite sufficient sleep duration, deep sleep demand was high due to high training volume; Week 4 post-taper, sleep quality (especially deep sleep proportion) significantly improved. Good sleep continuity throughout month, no frequent interruptions.
*   **Physical Health Trends:** Weight and estimated body fat % showed slow decline trend during training phase (Weeks 1-3), plateaued slightly in Week 4 taper possibly due to water retention changes. Resting Heart Rate and HRV showed clear "fatigue-recovery" correlation: Week 3 highest training load correlated with higher RHR, lower HRV; Week 4 taper correlated with lower RHR, significantly rebounded HRV.
*   **Mental Health Trends:** Stress levels generally stable, with minor fluctuations only during transactional work (Week 3 guiding new colleague, handling bank card) and pre-race (Week 5). Mood noticeably elevated after achieving milestones (salary increase, race completion) and social activities. Data suggests regular exercise and planned socializing are effective for maintaining good mental state.
*   **Injury Impact:** No major injury events this month. Only on Aug 11, feeling calf fatigue, proactively adjusted run to strength training, effectively preventing potential injury.

#### **3.3 Life Rhythm Trends**
*   **Sleep & Mental State:** Data shows when bedtime was after 23:30 (e.g., Aug 19, 22, 23), next morning mental alertness and exercise willingness slightly decreased. Maintaining early sleep (before 22:30) during taper period correlated with noticeably higher next-day energy levels.
*   **Work/Life Rhythm Changes:** Week 3 added "guiding new colleague" work role, bringing new responsibility and learning, indirectly boosting job satisfaction with positive mental impact. Increased social activities month-end (KTV, night fishing) served as pre-race stress relief, effectively balancing tense preparation atmosphere.

### **Module 4: Personalized Insights**

*   **Sleep ↔ Performance:** Data indicates that on days following ≥7 hours of sleep, particularly with deep sleep ≥1.5 hours, your aerobic training (tempo runs, long runs) pace stability improved ~3%, and perceived exertion decreased. Conversely, the night after the 30km run (Aug 18), despite earlier bedtime, deep sleep demand was extremely high, and extreme fatigue persisted the next day.
*   **Business Trip/Stress ↔ Health:** Brief camping trip (Aug 16-17) had minimal impact on health metrics. Outdoor activity replaced running, resting heart rate remained stable, HRV did not drop, proving moderate outdoor activity is effective active recovery. Work stress (e.g., guiding new colleague, technical discussions) did not worsen health metrics, instead stimulated learning and sense of achievement, demonstrating good stress transformation ability.
*   **Activity Type ↔ Physical State:** **Running** is your core method for improving cardio and weight control; monthly running >200 km directly correlated with 0.5kg weight loss. **Strength Training** (though only 3 sessions) played a key role in injury prevention (Aug 11 proactive adjustment) and improving running economy. **Hiking/Fishing** as low-intensity outdoor activities are effective for mental relaxation and social connection.
*   **Behavioral Habits ↔ Overall Health:** **Strong Planning Ability** (e.g., setting nutrition framework, daily pre-race plans, budget) is a core non-fitness factor in your successful half marathon achievement this month. It reduced anxiety from uncertainty and ensured discipline in training and recovery. **Pragmatic Financial Actions** (directed savings immediately after salary increase) brought significant psychological security and goal advancement feeling, indirectly stabilizing mood and health behaviors.
