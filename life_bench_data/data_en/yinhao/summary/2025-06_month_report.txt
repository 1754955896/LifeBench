            *   Break periods: 2 instances. First: 16th-18th (3 days), due to moving transition period and overtime work. Second: 20th (1 day), due to morning rain conflict. Recovery after breaks was smooth.

*   **Health Review**
    *   **Sleep**:
        *   Average Daily Sleep Duration: ~6.5 hours on weekdays, ~7.5 hours on weekends.
        *   Sleep Stage Distribution: Data missing. Inferred from sleep schedule stability, deep sleep percentage likely decreased mid-month due to disruptions, recovering by month-end.

        *   Business Travel/Vacation: 1 instance, returned to hometown Rudong, Jiangsu from 1st-3rd, minimal impact on exercise (maintained morning runs), sleep duration and quality were actually better due to family atmosphere.
    *   **Daily Life**:
        *   Screen Time: Average daily duration ~3.5 hours (work 1 hour + entertainment 2.5 hours). Highest duration occurred on days involving video editing learning and exam preparation review (e.g., 24th).

Takeout/eating out frequency increased (~8 times), concentrated during moving and social gatherings. Estimated average daily water intake ~1.8L.

**Monthly Trend Analysis**

*   **Activity Trends**
    *   **Weekly Activity Volume Changes**:
        *   Week 1 (1st-7th): 4 sessions (all running), holiday and plan initiation period, running volume steady.
        *   Week 2 (8th-14th): 5 sessions (4 running + 1 strength), increased running volume, introduced new training type, due to training plan execution and moving preparation.
        *   Week 3 (15th-21st): 3 sessions (all running), lowest monthly session count, primarily affected by moving transition, overtime, and weather.
        *   Week 4 (22nd-30th): 6 sessions (5 running + 1 other), highest monthly session frequency, significant improvement in running quality, as training returned to normal after life stabilized.
    *   **Training Cycle Peaks/Lows**:
        *   **Peak Week**: Week 4, running performance (pace) reached its best, activity consistency was highest.
        *   **Low Week**: Week 3, fewest activity sessions, most disrupted by life changes.
    *   **Performance Changes**: Running pace showed a "initiation-adaptation-disruption-breakthrough" curve. Weeks 1-2: steady execution; Week 3: slight stagnation due to disruptions; Week 4: achieved pace breakthrough after life stabilized and initial effects of cross-training appeared.

*   **Health Trends**
    *   **Sleep Trend**: Weekly sleep duration and quality showed a "V" shape. Weeks 1-2: acceptable; Week 3 (moving week): duration shortened, quality declined; Week 4: sleep duration and stability significantly recovered after proactively communicating and adjusting shared living arrangements.
    *   **Physical Health Trend**: Weight curve highly synchronized with life events: slight increase during holiday, slight increase during moving week (eating out + fatigue), slight increase after social events, decrease during regular activity weeks. Overall trend slightly downward, showing activity's controlling effect on weight.
    *   **Mental Health Trend**: Stress levels and mood fluctuated with events. Relaxed at month's beginning, stress increased mid-month due to household registration, exam prep, moving/friction, effectively released by month-end through problem-solving (communication, insurance purchase, exam simulation), social activities (escape room), and activity breakthroughs, mood turned positive.
    *   **Injury/Illness Impact**: Mild cold on the 25th led to reduced activity intensity that day but did not cause a training break, with quick recovery.

*   **Life Rhythm Trends**
    *   **Sleep Schedule & Mental State**: Data shows that when bedtime was after 23:30 (e.g., moving week), next-day mental state was often described as "fatigued", "slightly tired"; when bedtime was stable before 23:00, next-day state was often described as "focused", "energetic".
    *   **Work/Life Rhythm Changes**: Work intensity increased in Week 3 due to temporary overtime, compounded by moving tasks, creating dual pressure on activity and sleep; In Week 4, after adapting to the new life rhythm (shared rules, commute), activity and health metrics fully recovered.

**Personalized Insights**

*   **Sleep ↔ Activity Performance**: Data shows your running pace achieved a breakthrough during periods of stable sleep (e.g., Week 4); while activity frequency decreased during sleep-disrupted periods (Week 3). Specific correlation: When sleep duration was ≥7 hours for three consecutive days with stable bedtime, subjective feeling ("body feels light") and objective performance (pace) during next-day morning runs were better.
*   **Business Travel/Pressure ↔ Health**: Analysis shows short-term home visits had minimal impact on your activity habits, and family support was beneficial for mental health. However, work/life pressures (e.g., exam prep, moving) significantly impacted health: during high-stress periods (Weeks 2-3), your days with disrupted sleep increased, and weight showed minor fluctuations. Data shows that when you addressed stress sources through concrete actions like making plans (exam prep) and proactive communication (shared living), health metrics improved rapidly.
*   **Activity Type ↔ Physical State**: Comparison reveals that after introducing a single strength cross-training session (14th), you felt "improved body stability and endurance" in subsequent runs (17th, 25th). This indicates even low-frequency targeted strength training positively impacted your running economy and injury prevention.
*   **Behavioral Habits ↔ Overall Health**: Your behavior patterns show strong correlations: 1) **Regular sleep schedule is foundational**: When you maintained early morning runs and stable bedtime, daily efficiency and mood were more positive; 2) **Socializing & hobbies are buffers**: Social leisure activities like fishing and escape rooms effectively counterbalanced work and exam pressure, clearly reflected in data from the 21st and 28th; 3) **Problem-solving orientation**: Facing shared living friction and household registration confusion, you took proactive actions like communication and policy research, rather than passive anxiety, which is key to mental health resilience.

**Abnormal Event Summary**

    *   **Break Periods**: June 16th-18th, June 20th.
    *   **Duration**: First instance 3 days, second instance 1 day.
    *   **Causes**: First instance due to moving transition period (hotel stay) and work overtime; Second instance due to morning rain.
    *   **Post-Break Recovery Performance**: Resumed activity on the 19th (moving items), resumed running on the 21st, performance not noticeably affected.
*   **Health Metric Fluctuation Events**:

    *   **Fluctuation Magnitude**: Single-day increase of 0.2kg (from 71.2kg to 71.4kg).
    *   **Cause**: Outing for fishing that day, lunch was a lakeside picnic with higher-calorie snacks.
    *   **Subsequent Change**: Weight decreased by 0.1kg the next day (22nd) through morning run and return to normal diet, returning to normal fluctuation range by month-end.
*   **Life Rhythm Anomaly Events**:
