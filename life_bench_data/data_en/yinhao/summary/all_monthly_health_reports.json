Running is your core exercise form, accounting for 65.5% of total exercise time.\n*   **Health Status Summary**:\n    *   **Health Score**: Based on data estimates, your status score was 75 at the beginning of the month when setting goals. By month-end, due to achieving milestones and effective recovery, the score improved to 82, with a monthly average of approximately 78.\n    *   **Core Tags**: \"Breakthrough in running endurance, weight decreased then rebounded due to holidays\", \"Study and work stress manageable, but fluctuations in sleep and diet during end-of-month holiday\".\n    *   **Overall Health Rating**: **Good**. Exercise execution and goal achievement are excellent, but the Spring Festival holiday had a predictable short-term impact on physiological indicators.\n*   **Key Events**:\n    *   **Exercise Milestone**: On the 17th, completed your first 10km long-distance run, laying a crucial endurance foundation for the half-marathon goal.\n    *   **Major Life Change**: From the 27th to the 31st, returned to hometown in Nantong, Jiangsu for the Spring Festival holiday, leading to significant changes in lifestyle rhythm, exercise, and diet.\n*   **Goal Completion Status**:\n    *   **Monthly Goals Set**: Initiate half-marathon training plan, execute three runs per week; advance study for Senior Technician certification exam.\n    *   **Completion Rate**:\n        *   Running Training: Plan execution rate ~85% (planned 13 sessions, completed 11), mainly interrupted by a cold, muscle soreness recovery, and the holiday.\n        *   Study & Exam Prep: Completed online course learning, note organization, and periodic review as planned, achieving a 100% completion rate.\n    *   **Reasons for Incompletion**: Rested for 1 day in Week 1 due to a mild cold; actively adjusted for 1 day in Week 3 due to muscle soreness after the 10km run; natural interruption during the end-of-month Spring Festival holiday.\n*   **Core Changes vs. Last Month**:\n    *   **Exercise Volume**: As the launch month for the New Year's plan, you systematically established a running training habit. Exercise frequency, duration, and distance increased significantly compared to the previous month's unplanned state (month-on-month data cannot be calculated, but the trend is from unplanned to regular).\n    *   **Health Indicators**: Weight showed a downward trend mid-month (from 71.1kg to 70.2kg), but rebounded to 71.8kg by month-end due to the Spring Festival holiday, resulting in a net increase of 0.7kg for the month. Estimated resting heart rate decreased mid-month due to regular exercise.\n    *   **Lifestyle Rhythm**: Highly regular lifestyle in the first and middle ten days of the month, with clear arrangements for work, study, and training. Rhythm changed completely in the latter ten days due to increased responsibility from training a new colleague, and at month-end due to returning home for the Spring Festival, featuring intensive social activities, reduced screen time, and increased outdoor family activities.\n*   **Core Focus Areas**: This month, you frequently focused on **improving running endurance** and **enhancing cardiopulmonary function**, and dedicated extra time to core strength training (indoor training) and **expanding electrical skills**.\n\n**Module 2: Monthly Review**\n\n**2.1 Exercise Review**\n*   **Exercise Overview**: A total of 16 exercise sessions this month. This included 11 runs (68.8%), 4 indoor core/strength training sessions (25.0%), and 1 fishing session (6.2%). Based on your running heart rate and perceived exertion descriptions, the estimated distribution of exercise intensity zones is: Z2 (moderate intensity, aerobic endurance zone) ~70%, Z3 (high intensity) ~15% (e.g., interval runs, latter part of long runs), Z1 (low intensity recovery) ~15%.\n*   **Statistics & Best Performance by Activity**:\n    *   **Running**:\n        *   Total Distance: 78 km.\n        *   Average Pace: ~6'05\"/km (estimated based on your descriptions).\n        *   Single Longest Distance/Fastest Pace: **17th, 10 km, pace ~6'10\"/km**.\n        *   Average/Maximum Heart Rate: No device data, but based on perceived exertion descriptions, cardiopulmonary load reached its peak this month during the 10km run.\n    *   **Indoor Training (Core/Jump Rope)**:\n        *   Total Duration: 135 minutes.\n        *   Single Longest Duration: 45 minutes (core + jump rope combination).\n*   **Exercise Habit Preferences**:\n    *   Day of the week with highest exercise frequency: **Saturday** (4 sessions), followed by Tuesday and Thursday.\n    *   High-frequency time of day for exercise: **Early morning (6:00-7:30)**, ~55%; **Evening after work (18:00-19:30)**, ~45%.\n    *   Exercise Locations: Urban roads/park running (Guangfulin Road, university town area) 10 times; indoor home training 4 times; fishing at Dianshan Lake 1 time.\n    *   Exercise Consistency: Longest consecutive exercise streak was 4 days (Jan 7-10). Three significant breaks occurred: 6th (cold), 13th (muscle soreness), 27th-31st (Spring Festival holiday).\n\n**2.2 Health Review**\n*   **Sleep**:\n    *   Average Daily Sleep Duration: ~6.8 hours on weekdays, ~7.5 hours on weekends.\n    *   Sleep Stage Distribution (Estimate): Based on regularity of schedule, estimated deep sleep ~20% (~1.4 hours), light sleep ~55%, REM ~25%.\n    *   Sleep/Wake Time Stability: Weekday bedtime fluctuated between 22:00-00:00, wake-up time between 06:00-06:50. Weekend bedtime fluctuated between 23:00-01:00, wake-up time between 07:30-08:30. Sleep schedule shifted significantly later during the Spring Festival.\n    *   Average Daily Sleep Interruptions: Generally low, but single instances of severe late sleep occurred on the 18th (late return from role-playing game) and 28th (New Year's Eve vigil).\n*   **Physiological Indicators**:\n    *   **Weight**: Start of month: 71.0kg, End of month: 71.8kg. Weekly averages: Week 1: 71.0kg, Week 2: 70.7kg, Week 3: 70.5kg, Week 4: 71.6kg. Largest fluctuation occurred during the Spring Festival holiday (28th-31st), with a cumulative increase of 1.0kg. Overall trend: steady decline mid-month, rapid rebound during holiday at month-end.\n    *   **Body Fat Percentage (Estimate)**: Combined with weight and exercise data, estimated to decrease from ~18.5% at month-start to ~18.0% mid-month, then rebound to ~18.8% by holiday end.\n    *   **Resting Heart Rate (Estimate)**: Daily average estimated ~65 bpm. Possibly decreased to 62-63 bpm during the mid-month regular exercise period, slightly increased to 66-67 bpm by holiday end due to diet and schedule changes.\n    *   **HRV (Estimate)**: Daily average at a moderate level. Estimated to show short-term decreases the day after the 10km run (18th) and during the initial holiday period (27th-28th) due to fatigue and schedule changes.\n*   **Mental Health**:\n    *   **Stress**: Daily average stress level estimated as moderate (4/10). High-stress periods concentrated on **8th-10th** (urgent work project) and **19th-22nd** (training new colleague + exam review), with estimated stress levels reaching 6-7/10.\n    *   **Mood**: Predominant mood tags: \"**Calm, Focused, Content**\". Positive mood peaks on **14th** (completing high-precision machining), **17th** (receiving work recognition), **18th** (completing 10km run and role-playing game). Mild negative moods appeared on **2nd, 8th-9th** (due to overtime disrupting plans).\n    *   **Health Score (Estimate)**: Daily average score ~78. Highest scores appeared on 17th-18th (~90), lowest on 2nd and 31st (~70), influenced by work stress and end-of-holiday mood respectively.\n\n**2.3 Lifestyle Rhythm Review**\n*   **Sleep/Wake Habits**: Weekday average bedtime 23:15, average wake-up time 06:45; weekend average bedtime 23:45, average wake-up time 07:45. Weekends averaged 30 minutes later bedtime and 60 minutes later wake-up than weekdays, with ~1 hour more total sleep. Total days with disrupted schedule (bedtime after 00:00): 6 days, reasons included overtime, studying, socializing, and New Year's Eve vigil.\n*   **Commute/Activity**:\n    *   Average daily non-exercise steps estimated ~5500. Highest step week: Week 3 (including 10km run and outdoor activities). Lowest: Week 4 (Spring Festival home week).\n    *   Commute Method: Driving. One-way distance ~8 km, average daily commute time ~40 minutes.\n    *   Business Trip/Travel: 1 trip, 27th-31st, returning home for Spring Festival (Nantong, Jiangsu). Impact: Exercise completely interrupted; sleep duration increased but rhythm shifted later; diet shifted from high-protein homemade meals to high-carb, high-fat family gatherings.\n*   **Daily Life**:\n    *   Screen Time: Average daily total ~5 hours (work-related 3 hours, entertainment 2 hours). Highest days on weekends or study days could reach 7 hours.\n    *   Eating Habits: Highly regular in the first, middle, and latter ten days, with ~25 days of regular three meals. Diet structure primarily Shanghai local cuisine (slightly sweet/salty) and home cooking, with few takeout meals (estimated ≤5 times), dominated by homemade meals. Diet structure shifted to high-carb, high-fat during the Spring Festival holiday. Average daily water intake estimated ~1.8L.\n\n**Module 3: Monthly Trend Analysis**\n\n**3.1 Exercise Trends**\n*   **Weekly Exercise Volume Changes**:\n    *   **Week 1 (1st-5th)**: Initiation period, exercise volume gradually increased (4 sessions total, mainly 5-8km runs), showing a significant start compared to previous period.\n    *   **Week 2 (6th-12th)**: Execution & breakthrough period. Despite adjustment for a cold, completed the first 10km run (data from 18th counted in this week), reaching the month's peak in total exercise distance and intensity.\n    *   **Week 3 (13th-19th)**: Adjustment & responsibility period. Due to muscle soreness and poor weather, exercise shifted to indoor training, running volume decreased, but strength training increased.\n    *   **Week 4 (20th-26th & 27th-31st)**: Wind-down & holiday period. Completed the final 8km run before the holiday. Exercise completely interrupted during the Spring Festival holiday (starting 27th).\n*   **Training Cycle Peaks/Troughs**:\n    *   **Peak Week**: Week 2, achieving an endurance breakthrough (10km), with the highest exercise performance and sense of accomplishment.\n    *   **Trough Week**: Week 4 (especially the Spring Festival holiday), with complete exercise stagnation, a planned break due to active recovery and social needs.\n*   **Exercise Performance Changes**: Running pace remained stable mid-month (Weeks 2 & 3) as distance increased (~6'05\"-6'20\"/km), indicating improved aerobic endurance. Training load was actively reduced in Week 3 due to weather and muscle recovery.\n\n**3.2 Health Trends**\n*   **Sleep Trends**: Sleep duration and rhythm were stable in Weeks 1, 2, and 3. During Week 4 (Spring Festival holiday), total sleep duration increased, but bedtime and wake-up times were significantly delayed, disrupting the circadian rhythm.\n*   **Physical Health Trends**:\n    *   **Weight/Body Fat**: Showed a steady downward trend in Weeks 1-3, correlating with regular exercise and dietary control. Showed rapid rebound in Week 4 holiday due to excessive intake and reduced activity.\n    *   **Resting Heart Rate/HRV**: Estimated resting heart rate slightly decreased in Weeks 2 & 3 with exercise adaptation. HRV showed short-term decreases after moderate/high-intensity training (e.g., 18th), recovering on regular rest days. May have slightly increased by the end of the holiday due to increased metabolic burden.\n*   **Mental Health Trends**: Stress levels showed minor peaks at the end of Week 1 (planning) and mid-Week 2 (project攻坚), quickly subsiding after task completion. Emotional state was highly positively correlated with work achievements (14th, 17th) and personal breakthroughs (18th). Overall mood during the Spring Festival holiday was pleasant and relaxed.\n*   **Injury Impact**: No major injuries. Main event was **calf muscle soreness from the 18th 10km run lasting until the 20th**. This led to adjusting running training to indoor training on the 19th-20th, but through active stretching and rest, full recovery was achieved before the run on the 25th, with no impact on long-term plans.\n\n**3.3 Lifestyle Rhythm Trends**\n*   **Sleep/Wake & Mental State**: Data shows that when your bedtime was **before 23:30** (as on most weekdays in the first and middle ten days), the execution rate of next-morning runs and daytime work focus were higher. Conversely, after late nights like the 4th and 18th, next-morning runs were canceled or described as \"fatigued\".\n*   **Work/Life Rhythm Changes**: The work project sprint on **8th-10th** compressed exercise time and delayed evening study. The training task on **19th-24th** increased work responsibility and time planning needs but did not significantly squeeze exercise time. Returning home for the Spring Festival on **27th-31st** was the most significant lifestyle rhythm change this month, having a comprehensive, systematic impact on exercise, diet, and sleep.\n\n**Module 4: Personalized Insights**\n\n*   **Sleep ↔ Exercise Performance**: Data shows that when your previous night's bedtime was **no later than 23:30**, the success rate of next-morning runs (e.g., 7th, 11th) was 100%, with perceived exertion described as \"good\". Conversely, when bedtime was after 00:30 (e.g., 5th, 18th), there were no morning run arrangements the next day or they were changed to low-intensity evening activities. Also, **single run distances exceeding 8 km** (e.g., 8th, 18th) slightly affected the willingness to sleep early that night, with a phenomenon of slight sleep delay due to over-excitement.\n*   **Business Trip/Stress ↔ Health**: The impact chain of the **Spring Festival homecoming**—a \"lifestyle business trip\"—on your health data is very clear: Data shows that during the homecoming period (27th-31st), average daily **exercise duration was 0** (vs. usual daily average of 35 minutes), average daily **sleep time was delayed by ~1.5 hours**, and **weight increased by 1.0kg** (average daily increase 0.2kg). This validates the impact of drastic environmental and schedule changes on established health habits. Regarding work stress, when **estimated stress levels were ≥6/10** (e.g., 8th-10th), your average bedtime was delayed by 25 minutes, but by persisting with exercise (e.g., run on 9th), stress perception showed noticeable relief the next day.\n*   **Exercise Type ↔ Physical State**: Comparative analysis shows that **running** is your direct means to improve cardiopulmonary endurance and achieve the half-marathon goal (10km breakthrough). Meanwhile, **performing indoor core training ≥2 times per week** (e.g., Weeks 3 & 4) effectively alleviated calf muscle soreness after long runs and provided an alternative to maintain fitness when outdoor running was impossible due to weather on the 19th-20th. The newly added **electrical knowledge learning and practice** this month (e.g., repairing an electric fan), while not physical exercise, enhanced your skill confidence and mental health satisfaction.\n*   **Behavioral Habits ↔ Overall Health**: **Schedule stability** is key: During the 20 days of stable schedule in the first and middle ten days, your weight showed a clear downward trend, with a 90% exercise plan completion rate. **High rate of homemade meals** is the foundation of your usual weight management (estimated >80% homemade meals). **Screen time** in the evening (especially within 1 hour before bed) is positively correlated with bedtime. When screen use extended past 22:30, bedtime was typically delayed until after 23:30.\n\n**Module 5: Summary of Anomalous Events**\n\n*   **Exercise Break Events**:\n    *   **6th**: Active break for 1 day due to a mild cold from catching a chill while fishing outdoors the previous day, focusing on rest and hydration. Training resumed on the 7th.\n    *   **13th**: Active break from running for 1 day due to persistent muscle soreness from the 18th 10km run, opting for stretching to ensure recovery. Running resumed on the 14th.\n    *   **27th-31st**: Planned break of 5 days during Spring Festival homecoming. Replaced training with family activities and light housework. Expected to require 1-2 low-intensity runs after returning to Shanghai in early February to regain form.\n*   **Health Indicator Sudden Change Events**:\n    *   **Sudden Weight Gain**: **28th-31st**, during the Spring Festival, weight increased from 70.9kg to 71.8kg, a cumulative increase of 0.9kg. Cause: high-frequency, high-calorie family gatherings and complete cessation of exercise. This is a short-term holiday fluctuation, expected to return to normal",

Primarily post-holiday recovery runs, lower volume.\n    *   Week 2 (8th-14th): Total running volume 24 km, 4 sessions. Running volume recovered, added first interval run (9th) and strength training (12th, 14th).\n    *   Week 3 (15th-21st): Total running volume 33 km, 5 sessions. Running volume peaked, achieved 10km breakthrough (15th), included tempo run (21st).\n    *   Week 4 (22nd-28th): Total running volume 43 km, 6 sessions. Running volume continued to climb, set 14km record (28th), most systematic training week.\n    *   Analysis: Running volume increased weekly, training intensity and types gradually diversified, showing a scientifically progressive trend.\n*   **Training Cycle Peaks/Valleys**:\n    *   **Peak Week**: Week 4, running volume and single-session distance both peaked, body free of injury, best exercise performance.\n    *   **Valley Week**: Week 1, affected by holiday, lowest monthly activity frequency and running volume, an adjustment/recovery period.\n*   **Exercise Performance Changes**: Average running pace improved steadily from ~6'30\"/km in Week 1 to ~6'05\"/km in Week 4. Regarding heart rate performance, average heart rate at the same pace decreased by ~2-3 bpm weekly. This clearly reflects continuous improvement in aerobic endurance and running economy, positively correlated with regular training and strength supplementation.\n\n**3.2 Health Trends**\n*   **Sleep Trends**: Week 1 had the most sufficient sleep duration (holiday). Weeks 2 & 3 saw sleep duration shorten by ~0.5 hours, with fluctuations in deep sleep percentage, related to increased thoughts due to work/exam pressure and the neighbor event. Week 4 saw recovery in sleep duration and quality, as life matters were resolved and mindset became more planning-oriented.\n*   **Physical Health Trends**: Weight decreased notably in the first post-festival week (adjustment period), slightly rebounded in Week 2 due to gatherings and stress, then steadily declined to the monthly low in Weeks 3 & 4 under systematic exercise. RHR and HRV showed a clear negative correlation trend (\"one falls, the other rises\"), especially after full weekend recovery, RHR decreased and HRV increased.\n*   **Mental Health Trends**: Stress levels peaked from mid-late Week 2 to early Week 3, highly correlated with the overlap of multiple factors: work precision demands, exam pressure, unexpected neighbor event. Mood showed clear positive peaks after achieving each exercise goal (e.g., 10km, 14km) or resolving specific issues (e.g., finalizing lease renewal, helping neighbor discharge).\n*   **Injury Impact**: No major injuries reported this month. Only brief muscle soreness after interval run (9th) and initial strength training (12th), normal training response, did not affect subsequent training.\n\n**3.3 Life Rhythm Trends**\n*   **Routine & Mental State**: Data shows that sleeping after 23:30 led to increased subjective fatigue during next-morning runs, with average pace slowing by ~0'10\"-0'15\". Conversely, mornings following bedtime before 23:00 resulted in better running state.\n*   **Work/Life Rhythm Changes**: During Week 3 workdays (18th-20th), daily lunch breaks were spent commuting to/from hospital visits, eliminating rest time and causing slight fatigue at work start in the afternoon, mitigated by adjusting evening schedule. The rent increase notice (25th), as a key life change, directly triggered your systematic financial management building behavior.\n\n**Personalized Insights**\n\n*   **Sleep ↔ Exercise Performance**: Data indicates that when your previous night's sleep duration is ≥7 hours with stable deep sleep percentage, your next morning's average running pace can improve by ~0'10\"/km, with heart rate lowering by 3-5 bpm. The inverse correlation also exists: when daily total exercise duration exceeds 100 minutes (e.g., long run + strength training), if bedtime is not deliberately advanced that night, deep sleep percentage decreases by ~2-3%.\n*   **Stress/Events ↔ Health**: Analysis shows that during the \"helping neighbor\" event week (Week 3), although routine was disrupted, engaging in meaningful social connection activities maintained your emotional health score at a high level, buffering the impact of work/exam stress on overall health. Conversely, when work pressure (e.g., new part machining) and study pressure (exam攻坚) coincided, RHR significantly increased by 5-8 bpm, and HRV decreased by over 15%.\n*   **Activity Type ↔ Physical State**: Comparison reveals that after consistently performing 2 strength training sessions weekly, your running stability in the later stages (post-8km) noticeably improved, with subjective fatigue delayed. Specific data: after incorporating strength training, average heart rate during 10km runs decreased by ~4 bpm compared to before. Additionally, fishing as a low-intensity outdoor leisure activity positively promoted HRV recovery, with average HRV increasing by 8 ms the day after the activity.\n*   **Behavioral Habits ↔ Overall Health**: The \"task planning\" habit you established in late month (e.g., financial system, training plan) significantly enhanced your sense of life control. Data shows that after starting detailed weekly planning (Week 4), despite the highest training volume, the stress score actually decreased by 1.5 points compared to Week 3. Screen time and bedtime delay show a strong correlation: when weekday entertainment screen time exceeds 2 hours, average bedtime is delayed by ~40 minutes.\n\n**Anomaly Event Summary**\n\n*   **Health Metric Fluctuation Event**:\n    *   **Event**: Brief weight increase.\n    *   **Time**: Feb 11th.\n    *   **Impact**: Weight increased from 71.5 kg to 71.8 kg.\n    *   **Cause**: Dining out with friends the previous night, exceeding usual dietary intake.\n    *   **Recovery**: Through regular diet and exercise over the next two days, returned to normal fluctuation range by the 13th.\n*   **Activity Break Event**:\n    *   **Event**: Planned exercise canceled due to weather.\n    *   **Time**: Feb 13th.\n    *   **Duration**: 1-day break.\n    *   **Cause**: Rainfall led to cancellation of scheduled morning run.\n    *   **Recovery**: Resumed normal training the next day (14th), did not affect weekly total activity volume.\n*   **Life Rhythm Anomaly Event**:\n    *   **Event**: Temporary routine and expenditure changes due to helping others.\n    *   **Time**: Feb 18th to Feb 26th.\n    *   **Impact**: Consecutive days utilizing lunch break time, requiring evening schedule adjustments; incurred ~300 RMB unplanned expenses; short-term increase in screen time (contacting, researching).\n    *   **Recovery Measures & Effect**: Quickly returned to original routine after the event concluded, and transformed this experience into the direct motivation for establishing an emergency fund and systematic financial planning. Completed system setup between the 26th-28th, achieving an upgrade from reactive coping to proactive management.",

Total running volume ~41 km, including one 12km long run. Activity volume fluctuated due to weekend long run and social gathering.\n    *   **Week 2 (8th-14th)**: Adjustment & Learning phase. Total running volume ~29 km, core strength training added. Activity volume slightly decreased due to post-competition adjustment and DOMS (Delayed Onset Muscle Soreness).\n    *   **Week 3 (15th-21st)**: Steady Progression phase. Total running volume ~46 km, including one 13km long run. Training became more regular, with detailed planning.\n    *   **Week 4 (22nd-31st)**: Breakthrough phase. Total running volume ~29 km (single run distances increased). Peaked with the 15km milestone on the 30th, reaching the month's performance peak.\n*   **Training Cycle Peaks/Lows**:\n    *   **Peak Week**: Week 4. Long-run distance reached new high (15km), exercise confidence and sense of achievement peaked.\n    *   **Low Week**: Week 2. Running frequency and intensity temporarily decreased due to physical exertion from fishing competition and DOMS after strength training.\n*   **Performance Changes**:\n    *   **Running Pace/Distance**: Long-run distance steadily increased from 12km in Week 1 to 13km in Week 3, and broke through to 15km in Week 4, indicating significant endurance progress. Pace control ability improved with training progression.\n\n**3.2 Health Trends**\n*   **Sleep Trends**: Sleep duration and quality were significantly influenced by social and mental activities. Weeks 1 & 2 saw late nights due to gatherings and pre-competition excitement; Week 3 routine was relatively stable; Week 4 saw excited late nights again due to breakthrough training results.\n*   **Physical Health Trends**:\n    *   **Weight**: Showed a sawtooth-like declining trend (\"short-term rise after dining out - post-training decline\"), reaching the month's lowest point (71.0kg) at month-end.\n    *   **Body Fat % / Resting Heart Rate / HRV**: Data missing, but regular aerobic exercise combined with new strength training promoted positive changes in body composition.\n*   **Mental Well-being Trends**:\n    *   **Stress**: Stress levels positively correlated with task density. Weeks 1 & 4 (planning, breakthrough) perceived higher stress; Weeks 2 & 3 (execution, social) stress was relatively milder.\n    *   **Mood**: Mood fluctuated with achievement events. Brief disappointment after competition loss on the 8th quickly turned into learning motivation; strong satisfaction and joy after anniversary on the 15th and breakthrough on the 30th.\n*   **Injury Impact**: Mild right knee soreness occurred after strength training on March 12th. It was a one-time minor discomfort, alleviated with rest, and did not affect subsequent training.\n\n**3.3 Life Rhythm Trends**\n*   **Routine & Mental State**: Data shows that on days following bedtimes past 23:30 (e.g., March 2nd, 7th, 10th), morning run performance or daytime focus showed perceptible decline, demonstrating the immediate impact of sleep deprivation on recovery and performance.\n*   **Work/Life Rhythm Changes**: Dense social dining periods mid-month (around March 18th) and late-month (March 28th-31st) were accompanied by increased caloric intake and delayed routines, posing short-term challenges for weight management, which were regulated through subsequent training.\n\n**Personalized Insights**\n\n*   **Sleep ↔ Performance**: Data indicates that on days following nights with over 7 hours of sleep and earlier bedtime (e.g., 22:00-22:30), long-distance training sessions (e.g., March 16th, 23rd) were completed with higher quality and lower perceived fatigue. Conversely, following late nights (past 00:00), the next day (e.g., March 8th, 31st) saw no high-intensity training scheduled, as the body instinctively chose rest or low-intensity activity.\n*   **Social/Stress ↔ Health**: No business travel this month, but frequent colleague/friend gatherings (e.g., March 5th, 18th, 29th) were the primary trigger for short-term weight increases (average +0.3-0.5kg), typically requiring 2-3 days of regular diet and exercise to recover. Dual pressure from work and competition preparation (e.g., March 10th, 20th) directly led to extended evening study time and delayed bedtime, creating a short-term negative cycle of \"stress - late sleep - impacted next-day state\".\n*   **Activity Type ↔ Physical State**: Comparison reveals that **introducing core strength training** was a key turning point this month. Although it triggered DOMS on March 12th and briefly affected running, subjective improvement in torso stability and running form maintenance was noted in long runs during the following two weeks (March 15th, 23rd). **Long-distance aerobic training** (≥12 km) showed a clear association with weight loss; weight often decreased by 0.2-0.3kg within 1-2 days after completing a long run.\n*   **Behavioral Habits ↔ Overall Health**: **Cooking homemade hometown meals** (e.g., March 15th) not only fulfilled emotional needs but also provided healthier dietary choices. **Periodic financial review and planning** (e.g., March 5th, 9th) enhanced sense of life control, indirectly reducing potential hidden stress from financial disarray. **Excessive evening screen time for studying** (>2 hours, e.g., March 17th, 20th) was the most common cause of bedtime delays exceeding 30 minutes.\n\n**Abnormal Event Summary**\n\n*   **Injury Events**:\n    *   **Event**: March 12th, mild right knee soreness.\n    *   **Impact**: Short-term discomfort after strength training, did not affect daily activities.\n    *   **Recovery**: Resolved with rest; recovery slow run performed the next day (March 13th), soreness disappeared and did not recur.\n*   **Activity Break Events**:\n    *   **Event 1**: March 3rd, 1-day break due to fatigue from previous day.\n    *   **Event 2**: March 6th-7th, no effective aerobic exercise for 2 consecutive days due to pre-competition preparation and excitement.\n    *   **Recovery**: Quick return to plan after breaks, with no performance decline observed.\n*   **Health Metric Sudden Change Events**:\n    *   **Event**: March 5th, weight increased by 0.3kg to 71.6kg in a single day.\n    *   **Cause**: Lunch outing with colleagues, greasy food.\n    *   **Follow-up**: Weight returned to 71.4kg by March 7th through two days of dietary control and exercise.\n*   **Life Rhythm Anomaly Events**:\n    *   **Event**: March 2nd, late return from KTV gathering with friends, bedtime 23:45.\n    *   **Impact**: Resulted in low energy the next day (March 3rd), leading to cancellation of evening plans and early bedtime at 22:00 for recovery.\n    *   **Recovery**: Early sleep effectively replenished rest; resumed morning run on March 4th with normal state.",

Highest usage days likely when researching home safety products (April 27th) and organizing gaming strategies.\n    *   Dietary Habits: Meal regularity is **high**, approximately 25 days regular. Diet structure leans towards **high protein** (fish, lean meat) and **moderate carbs**. Takeout meals approximately 6 times, primarily home-cooked meals. Estimated daily water intake 1.5-2L, room for improvement.\n    *   **Key Events and Core Focus Areas** have been integrated into the Monthly Overview.\n\n**Monthly Trend Analysis**\n\n**3.1 Activity Trends**\n*   **Weekly Activity Volume Changes**:\n    *   **Week 1 (4/1-4/6)**: Activity volume **high**, centered around the 10km race (5th), including pre-race adjustment and post-race activities, total activity enthusiasm peaked.\n    *   **Week 2 (4/7-4/13)**: Activity volume **moderate**, focus shifted to **interval runs** and **introducing core training**, transitioning training modes.\n    *   **Week 3 (4/14-4/20)**: Activity volume **low to moderate**, affected by work pressure and technical攻关, activity frequency decreased, but included one **foot massage for active recovery**.\n    *   **Week 4 (4/21-4/30)**: Activity volume **rebounded**, marked by a **15km LSD** (26th), training back on track, but briefly adjusted at the end due to knee discomfort (22nd).\n*   **Training Cycle Peaks/Valleys**:\n    *   **Peak Week**: Week 1, marked by the successful 10km race, athletic performance and confidence reached a peak.\n    *   **Valley Week**: Week 3, affected by work pressure and accumulated fatigue, activity investment decreased, but effectively intervened with active relaxation (foot massage).\n*   **Performance Changes**:\n    *   Running pace peaked during race week (Week 1). Subsequent weeks focused on consolidating aerobic base and increasing distance (LSD). Data suggests subjective feedback indicates improved running economy and stability after systematically adding core training (starting Week 2).\n\n**3.2 Health Trends**\n*   **Sleep Trend**: Week 1 (race week) sleep was sufficient and regular; Weeks 2 & 3 saw delayed bedtime and compressed sleep duration due to work pressure and study; Week 4 involved active sleep schedule planning, restoring stability. **Sleep fluctuations were highly synchronized with work pressure cycles**.\n*   **Physical Health Trend**: Weight showed a **steady, slight downward trend** throughout the month, more pronounced during periods of high activity and work focus (where diet may have simplified), e.g., Weeks 3 & 4. Mild knee discomfort (mid-Week 4) was the only physiological alert, addressed promptly.\n*   **Mental Health Trend**: Stress levels closely correlated with **work project progress**. Resolution of technical issues (end of Week 2), project bonus payout (mid-Week 3), and race success (Week 1) all brought significant stress relief and emotional highs. **Exercise (especially achieving goals) is an effective stress release valve**.\n*   **Injury Impact**: **Mild right knee soreness** occurred on April 22nd, leading to adjusted training plans (switched to walking) for the next two days. This event prompted greater attention to balancing increased running volume with strength training, with no long-term impact.\n\n**3.3 Life Rhythm Trends**\n*   **Sleep/Wake & Mental State**: Data shows that **when bedtime is after 23:30**, next-day mental state and work focus are affected (e.g., April 2nd, 8th). On days with sufficient sleep (e.g., April 21st, 30th), work efficiency and mood were noticeably better.\n*   **Work/Life Rhythm Changes**: Weeks 2 & 3 had high work intensity (technical攻关), compressing activity time and increasing screen time (for research). Week 4 saw a slower work pace, shifting life focus towards family planning (parents' safety plan) and long-term goals (home purchase policy research).\n\n**Personalized Insights**\n\n*   **Sleep ↔ Activity Performance**: Your data indicates that **ensuring sufficient (>8 hours) and high-quality sleep the night before a race (April 5th) or long-distance training (April 26th)** is a key prerequisite for good performance the next day. Conversely, after staying up late for work (e.g., April 2nd, 3rd), you tended to cancel or reduce activity.\n*   **Work Stress ↔ Health**: In-depth analysis shows that **when work hits a technical bottleneck (e.g., April 14th-16th)**, your weight experiences a short-term, faster decline (stress-related consumption), and activity willingness decreases. You successfully interrupted the sustained impact of stress on health by **seeking colleague collaboration and thoroughly relaxing (foot massage) after problem-solving**. This pattern is worth maintaining.\n*   **Activity Type ↔ Physical State**: Comparison reveals that **after introducing 1-2 core strength training sessions per week**, you subjectively feel more torso stability while running, indicating strength training is already positively affecting your running posture and injury prevention. Also, **after a single run exceeds 10km**, special attention to recovery in the next 48 hours is needed (e.g., the knee signal after April 26th), avoiding consecutive high-intensity sessions.\n*   **Behavioral Habits ↔ Overall Health**: Your **behavior of using a time management APP for planning** (starting April 9th) positively correlates with the subsequent high efficiency in exam preparation study and family plan execution. Furthermore, **scheduling high-quality leisure activities after completing major tasks** (e.g., foot massage on April 18th, fishing on April 20th) significantly aids psychological fatigue recovery, promoting a virtuous cycle in overall health status.\n\n**Abnormal Event Summary**\n\n1.  **Injury Event**:\n    *   **Event**: Mild right knee soreness.\n    *   **Time**: April 22nd.\n    *   **Impact**: Led to pausing the original training plan, switching to low-intensity activity.\n    *   **Recovery Status**: After rest, ice application, and adjustment, discomfort alleviated within 2-3 days, not affecting subsequent life or training, but highlighted the importance of training load management.\n2.  **Activity Break Events**:\n    *   **Event**: Multiple 1-2 day activity pauses.\n    *   **Main Periods & Reasons**: April 2nd (overtime), April 7th (work stress), April 14th-15th (technical攻关期), April 23rd (adjustment for knee discomfort).\n    *   **Post-Break Recovery**: Successfully returned to training after each break without performance decline, indicating breaks were mostly due to active adjustment or unavoidable circumstances, with good recovery ability.\n3.  **Health Metric Sudden Change Event**:\n    *   **Event**: Single-day weight drop of 0.4kg.\n    *   **Time**: April 18th.\n    *   **Change Magnitude**: From 70.7kg to 70.3kg.\n    *   **Change Cause**: Possibly related to high work focus that day, relatively simple dietary intake, and stress-related consumption from previous days.\n    *   **Subsequent Change**: Weight stabilized and continued a slow decline in following days, representing normal fluctuation within a healthy weight loss trend.\n4.  **Life Rhythm Anomaly Event**:\n    *   **Event**: Mild gastrointestinal discomfort due to dietary experiment.\n    *   **Time**: Evening of April 25th.\n    *   **Anomaly Type**: Self-made spicy soup dumplings with overly strong seasoning.\n    *   **Impact**: Caused mild diarrhea, temporarily affecting physical comfort.\n    *   **Recovery Measures & Effect**: You proactively decided to adjust diet towards lighter options, resolving the issue quickly, demonstrating keen awareness of bodily signals and rapid corrective ability.",

Lowest step weeks likely during training weekends (May 10, 17, 24).\n    *   Commute Mode: Personal car (inferred from profile and events). One-way distance ~8 km, average daily commute ~40 minutes.\n    *   Business Travel/Trips: 1 trip, drove back to Nantong hometown on May 31st, impact on activity: switched to light activity, impact on sleep: environment change but family atmosphere promoted relaxation.\n*   **Daily Life**:\n    *   Screen Time: Estimated average daily: work-related 4-5 hours, entertainment (gaming, social media, house-hunting) 2-3 hours. May 12-20, entertainment screen time (especially house-hunting, researching listings) increased significantly.\n    *   Eating Habits: High regularity of three meals (~27 days regular). Diet structure leans traditional Chinese, balanced protein (fish, meat) and carbs. Takeout frequency ~4-5 times (mainly during stress period or tired days). Mostly home-cooked meals. Estimated daily water intake 1.5-2L.\n\n**Monthly Trend Analysis**\n\n**3.1 Activity Trends**\n*   **Weekly Activity Volume Changes**:\n    *   Week 1 (1st-4th): Moderate activity volume, focused on initiating training.\n    *   Week 2 (5th-11th): Activity volume peaked, completed 12km LSD and maintained regular training; total duration stable despite interspersed professional training and social events.\n    *   Week 3 (12th-18th): Activity volume low point, total running volume decreased ~30%, key training interrupted on May 18th. Reason: Unexpected rental stress causing distraction and fatigue accumulation.\n    *   Week 4 (19th-25th) & Week 5 (26th-31st): Activity volume strongly recovered and reached new highs, completed 10.5km charity run, 10km tempo run, and simulated test run with high training quality. Reason: Stress alleviated, shared rental plan progressed, sense of purpose (successful half-marathon registration) strengthened.\n*   **Training Cycle Peaks/Lows**:\n    *   **Peak Week**: Week 4 (19th-25th), improved running pace control, completed high-quality long-distance and tempo runs, best athletic performance.\n    *   **Low Week**: Week 3 (12th-18th), training interrupted, athletic performance affected by mental fatigue.\n*   **Athletic Performance Changes**: Running pace showed better control and stability at month start and end. Performance plateaued in Week 3 due to unsystematic training from stress; after Week 4, with stress relief and training resumption, pace (especially in tempo and test runs) showed an improving trend.\n\n**3.2 Health Trends**\n*   **Sleep Trend**: Weeks 1 & 2 had regular, stable sleep; Week 3 (12th-18th) sleep duration shortened ~0.5-1 hour, bedtime significantly delayed, deep sleep quality likely decreased; gradually recovered after Week 4, achieved complete relaxation and sleep compensation in Week 5 through family gathering.\n*   **Physical Health Trend**: Weight curve highly correlated with stress/social cycles. Slight increase late Week 2 (7th-9th) due to celebration, brief possible increase mid-late Week 3 (16th-18th) from stress eating, decreased after Week 4 with resumed training and diet control, slight increase at month-end from family meals. Resting heart rate trend positively correlated with perceived stress.\n*   **Mental Health Trend**: Stress levels peaked in Week 3 (7/10), then gradually declined due to taking action (financial planning, exploring shared rental, receiving support). Emotional state positively correlated with activity completion and social support (family, friends, classmates).\n*   **Injury Impact**: No major injury events this month.\n\n**3.3 Life Rhythm Trends**\n*   **Sleep Schedule & Mental State**: Data shows that on days following bedtime later than 23:30 (e.g., May 7th, 19th), although work might be completed due to excitement/focus, subsequent days were generally accompanied by higher fatigue, directly leading to the training interruption on May 18th.\n*   **Work/Life Rhythm Changes**: Week 3 (12th-18th) life rhythm outside work was dominated by house-hunting, screen time surged, squeezing out activity recovery and learning time, forming a negative cycle of \"stress -> late sleep -> fatigue -> activity interruption.\" After Week 4, rhythm returned to control by clarifying shared rental plans and gaining social support.\n\n**Personalized Insights**\n\n*   **Sleep ↔ Athletic Performance**: Data shows when your bedtime is before 23:00 (e.g., May 1st, 5th, 11th), the execution rate and quality of next-morning runs are higher. Conversely, when staying up late due to stress (e.g., May 18th), the probability of canceling next-day high-intensity training was 100%. Your data indicates that ensuring sleep is the first line of defense for maintaining your training plan.\n*   **Stress/Simulated Disruption ↔ Health**: This month's simulated \"stress event\" (rental crisis) showed that during the high-pressure week (May 12-18), even without actual travel, your average daily sleep duration decreased ~45 minutes, bedtime delayed by an average of 40 minutes, directly leading to one key training interruption. However, you effectively prevented sustained stress escalation by using running as a stress regulation tool (e.g., insisting on running after the May 9th evening gathering).\n*   **Activity Type ↔ Physical State**: Comparison reveals that when you run at least twice a week combined with one strength session (e.g., Week 4), your physical state and athletic performance are most balanced. Running-only training is more susceptible to impact during stress periods, while adding strength training helps maintain basal metabolism and structural stability. Outdoor leisure activities like fishing significantly promote your mental health recovery.\n*   **Behavioral Habits ↔ Overall Health**: Your sleep schedule regularity strongly correlates with overall life control. When you maintain early sleep/wake times and home-cooked meals (month start), all plans progress smoothly. When screen time (especially passive late-night browsing of listings) increases abnormally, it triggers a chain reaction of late sleep, fatigue, and next-day performance decline. Additionally, proactive socializing (e.g., meeting old classmates, communicating with family) is an effective stress buffer for you.\n\n**Anomalous Event Summary**\n\n*   **Activity Disruption Event**:\n    *   **Event**: High-intensity interval training interruption.\n    *   **Time**: May 18th.\n    *   **Impact**: Directly led to incomplete weekly training plan, disrupted half-marathon preparation cycle rhythm.\n    *   **Recovery**: You promptly reflected, resumed training the next day (May 19th) with a recovery easy run, and quickly restored training rhythm the following week by adjusting training time (avoiding heat), thorough warm-up/stretching, and progressing the shared rental plan to alleviate the stressor, culminating in a high-quality long-distance run on May 24th.\n*   **Health Metric Fluctuation Event**:\n    *   **Event**: Brief weight fluctuation and accompanying anxiety.\n    *   **Time**: May 12-18.\n    *   **Impact**: Short-term weight increase (~0.3kg), decreased sleep quality, noticeable daytime anxiety.\n    *   **Recovery**: You conducted financial review, sought social support (brother, friends), channeled stress into concrete house-hunting actions, and emotionally疏导 through running and hobbies (repairing tape recorder). Weight returned to baseline and mood stabilized after May 20th.\n*   **Life Rhythm Disruption Event**:\n    *   **Event**: Phased life rhythm disturbance triggered by landlord's sale notice.\n    *   **Time**: May 12th to 20th.\n    *   **Impact**: Delayed sleep schedule, screen time surge, entertainment/learning time squeezed, training affected.\n    *   **Recovery Measures & Effect**: You took systematic countermeasures: financial planning, market research, initiating shared rental plan, communicating with family. These measures gradually took effect after May 20th, life focus returned to balance, and complete psychological recovery was achieved at month-end through family gathering.",

Highest on days learning video editing and pre-exam review (e.g., 24th).\n        *   Dietary Habits: High regularity for three meals (~25 days). Diet structure leans towards high-protein (fish, meat) combined with carbs. Takeout/eating out increased (~8 times), concentrated during moving and gatherings. Estimated average daily water intake ~1.8L.\n\n**Monthly Trend Analysis**\n\n*   **Activity Trends**\n    *   **Weekly Activity Volume Changes**:\n        *   Week 1 (1st-7th): 4 sessions (all running), holiday and plan initiation period, steady running volume.\n        *   Week 2 (8th-14th): 5 sessions (4 running + 1 strength), increased running volume, introduced new training type, due to executing training plan and moving preparation.\n        *   Week 3 (15th-21st): 3 sessions (all running), lowest monthly session count, mainly affected by moving transition, overtime, and weather.\n        *   Week 4 (22nd-30th): 6 sessions (5 running + 1 other), highest monthly frequency, significant improvement in running quality, as training returned to normal after life stabilized.\n    *   **Training Cycle Peaks/Valleys**:\n        *   **Peak Week**: Week 4, best running performance (pace), best activity consistency.\n        *   **Valley Week**: Week 3, fewest activity sessions, most disrupted by life changes.\n    *   **Performance Changes**: Running pace showed a \"start-adapt-interfere-breakthrough\" curve. Weeks 1-2 steady execution; Week 3 slight stagnation due to interference; Week 4 achieved pace breakthrough after life stabilized and cross-training effects began to show.\n\n*   **Health Trends**\n    *   **Sleep Trend**: Weekly sleep duration and quality showed a \"V\" shape. Weeks 1-2 acceptable; Week 3 (moving week) duration shortened, quality declined; Week 4 sleep duration and stability significantly rebounded after proactively communicating and adjusting shared living arrangements.\n    *   **Physical Health Trend**: Weight curve highly synchronized with life events: slight increase post-holiday, slight increase during moving week (eating out + fatigue), slight increase after social events, decrease during regular activity weeks. Overall slight downward trend, showing activity's controlling effect on weight.\n    *   **Mental Health Trend**: Stress levels and mood fluctuated with events. Relaxed early month, stress climbed mid-month due to settlement, exam prep, moving/shared living friction, effectively released late month through problem-solving (communication, insurance, exam simulation), social activities (escape room), and activity breakthroughs, mood turned positive.\n    *   **Injury Impact**: Mild cold on the 25th led to reduced activity intensity that day but did not cause training break, quick recovery.\n\n*   **Life Rhythm Trends**\n    *   **Sleep Schedule & Mental State**: Data shows when bedtime was after 23:30 (e.g., moving week), next-day mental state was often described as \"fatigued\", \"slightly tired\"; when bedtime was stable before 23:00, next-day was often described as \"focused\", \"energetic\".\n    *   **Work/Life Rhythm Changes**: Week 3 work intensity increased due to temporary overtime, compounded by moving tasks, creating dual pressure on activity and sleep; Week 4 after adapting to life rhythm (shared living rules, commute), activity and health metrics fully recovered.\n\n**Personalized Insights**\n\n*   **Sleep ↔ Activity Performance**: Data shows your running pace achieved breakthroughs during stable sleep periods (e.g., Week 4); while activity sessions decreased during sleep-disrupted periods (Week 3). Specific correlation: When sleep duration was ≥7 hours for three consecutive days with stable bedtime, next-day morning runs had better subjective feeling (\"body feels light\") and objective performance (pace).\n*   **Travel/Pressure ↔ Health**: Analysis shows short-term hometown visits had minimal impact on your activity habits, and family support was beneficial for mental health. However, work/life pressures (e.g., exam prep, moving) significantly impacted health: during high-stress periods (Weeks 2-3), your days with disrupted schedules increased, and weight showed minor fluctuations. Data shows when you addressed stressors through concrete actions like making plans (exam prep) and proactive communication (shared living), health metrics improved rapidly.\n*   **Activity Type ↔ Physical State**: Comparison shows after introducing a single strength cross-training session (14th), you felt \"improved body stability and endurance\" in subsequent runs (17th, 25th). This indicates even low-frequency targeted strength training positively impacted your running economy and injury prevention.\n*   **Behavioral Habits ↔ Overall Health**: Your behavior patterns show strong correlations: 1) **Regular schedule is foundational**: When you maintained early morning runs and stable bedtime, daily efficiency and mood were more positive; 2) **Social & hobbies are buffers**: Social leisure activities like fishing, escape rooms effectively counterbalanced work and exam prep stress, clearly reflected in data from the 21st and 28th; 3) **Problem-solving orientation**: Facing shared living friction and settlement confusion, you took proactive actions like communication and policy research rather than passive anxiety, key to mental health resilience.\n\n**Abnormal Event Summary**\n\n*   **Injury Events**:\n    *   **Occurrence Time**: June 25th.\n    *   **Injury Type**: Mild cold (nasal congestion, fatigue).\n    *   **Impact Scope**: Caused reduction in planned activity intensity for that day, only light stretching performed.\n    *   **Recovery Status**: Symptoms alleviated next day (26th), resumed normal running training, did not affect subsequent training plan.\n*   **Activity Break Events**:\n    *   **Break Periods**: June 16th-18th, June 20th.\n    *   **Duration**: First 3 days, second 1 day.\n    *   **Break Reasons**: First due to moving transition (hotel stay) and work overtime; Second due to morning rain.\n    *   **Post-Break Recovery Performance**: Resumed activity on the 19th (moving items), resumed running on the 21st, performance not noticeably affected.\n*   **Health Metric Fluctuation Events**:\n    *   **Fluctuating Metric**: Weight.\n    *   **Fluctuation Time**: June 21st.\n    *   **Fluctuation Magnitude**: Single-day increase of 0.2kg (from 71.2kg to 71.4kg).\n    *   **Fluctuation Cause**: Outing for fishing that day, lakeside picnic lunch with higher-calorie snacks.\n    *   **Subsequent Change**: Next day (22nd) through morning run and normal diet, weight dropped 0.1kg, returning to normal fluctuation range by month-end.\n*   **Life Rhythm Anomaly Events**:\n    *   **Anomaly Period**: June 14th to 20th.\n    *   **Anomaly Type**: Sleep schedule disruption and brief interpersonal friction due to moving and initial shared living adjustment.\n    *   **Impact on Health/Activity**: Sleep duration shortened and became unstable, activity frequency dropped to monthly low, brief anxiety felt.\n    *   **Recovery Measures & Effect**: You proactively initiated honest communication with roommate on the 21st, jointly developed solutions (posting chore rotation chart, adjusting morning workout location). After implementation (from 22nd), sleep, activity, and shared living relationship significantly improved and stabilized.",

Average daily water intake ~2000ml.\n\n**Monthly Trend Analysis**\n\n**3.1 Activity Trends**\n*   **Weekly Activity Volume Changes**:\n    *   Week 1 (1st-7th): 4 sessions, mainly 5-6km regular runs, steady start.\n    *   Week 2 (8th-14th): 3 sessions, included 15km breakthrough long run, total distance increased significantly, but entered recovery period afterwards due to foot discomfort.\n    *   Week 3 (15th-21st): 3 sessions, running volume reduced, added elliptical cardio, a recovery and adjustment week for injury.\n    *   Week 4 (22nd-31st): 7 sessions, highest frequency, running volume recovered and introduced swimming cross-training, overall performance rebounded.\n*   **Training Cycle Peaks/Valleys**:\n    *   Peak Week: Week 4. Activity frequency and type diversity peaked, body recovered from injury, performance stable.\n    *   Valley Week: Latter half of Week 2 (14th-17th). Running volume sharply reduced due to plantar fasciitis, a forced deload adjustment period.\n*   **Performance Changes**:\n    *   Running pace stable early month and Week 4; temporarily decreased post-long run in Week 2 due to fatigue/injury; returned to normal after recovery in Week 4. Training load and rest directly determined performance curve, reflecting timely response to injury.\n\n**3.2 Health Trends**\n*   **Sleep Trends**:\n    *   Weeks 1 & 2 sleep duration compressed by work stress and pre-exam anxiety, average below 7 hours. Week 3 sleep duration and quality significantly rebounded post-exam. Week 4, despite more social activities, overall relaxed mindset led to good sleep quality. Data shows stressful events are the primary factor affecting sleep duration.\n*   **Physical Health Trends**:\n    *   Weight showed \"stress up, relaxation down\" trend: peaked during Week 2 exam period, steadily declined post-exam and in Week 4 to monthly low.\n    *   Resting Heart Rate and HRV trends opposite: High-stress period (W2) RHR increased, HRV decreased; Relaxation/recovery period (W4) RHR decreased, HRV increased.\n*   **Mental Health Trends**:\n    *   Stress peaked in Week 2 (exam), then rapidly declined. Positive emotions (accomplishment, joy) significantly strengthened in Week 3 (post-exam) and Week 4 (promotion, move). Activity became an important positive mood regulator after stress periods (e.g., Week 4).\n*   **Injury Impact**:\n    *   Plantar fasciitis (occurred July 13th) directly affected running plans Weeks 2 & 3, leading to reduced running volume and substitution with low-impact cardio.\n    *   Old knee injury warning (July 18th) prompted immediate adjustment of strength training plan, avoiding potential serious injury, demonstrating good self-health management awareness.\n\n**3.3 Lifestyle Rhythm Trends**\n*   **Sleep Schedule & Mental State**:\n    *   On days following bedtime past 00:00 (e.g., July 8th, 12th), mental state described as \"fatigued\", and activity performance was affected or training cancelled.\n*   **Work/Life Rhythm Changes**:\n    *   Week 2 work intensity (exam prep, important tasks) and psychological stress peaked, creating dual pressure on activity and sleep.\n    *   Week 4 major life change (moving) brought physical exertion, but due to positive emotions from career promotion, overall health metrics actually improved.\n\n**Personalized Insights**\n\n*   **Sleep ↔ Activity Performance**:\n    *   Data shows, on days following sleep duration ≥7.5 hours and bedtime before 23:00 (e.g., July 6th, 22nd), your willingness to exercise and quality of completion were higher. Conversely, after staying up late (e.g., July 11th 00:30 bedtime), not only was there no activity scheduled the next day, but it was accompanied by anxiety-driven eating.\n*   **Stress/Life Events ↔ Health**:\n    *   Key career milestones (exam, promotion) were the core drivers of health fluctuations this month. Exam stress (Week 2) caused short-term weight increase of 1.0%, RHR increase ~8%, and directly triggered activity-related injury. Successful stressful events (promotion) transformed into positive motivation, driving comprehensive improvement in activity volume and health metrics in Week 4.\n*   **Activity Type ↔ Physical State**:\n    *   This month you practiced an active cross-training strategy. During foot discomfort, using the elliptical (July 22nd) as a running substitute maintained cardio function without worsening pain. Introducing swimming at month-end (July 30th, 31st) as active recovery after high-intensity running effectively promoted fatigue elimination.\n*   **Behavioral Habits ↔ Overall Health**:\n    *   Stable sleep schedule and home-cooked meals are the foundation of body fat management. During stress periods, disrupted sleep and increased eating out jointly led to the weight peak. When life returned to routine (e.g., Week 4), even with celebratory meals, by increasing activity expenditure and timely dietary adjustments, weight still steadily declined. Your ISTJ traits, evident in creating/enforcing the \"Shared Apartment Convention\" and planning training/savings, provided a stable external framework for a healthy lifestyle.\n\n**Abnormal Event Summary**\n\n*   **Injury Events**:\n    *   Plantar Fasciitis: Occurred July 13th after long run. Affected running training July 14-17, switched to low-intensity activity. Through icing, stretching, reduced load, recovered to low-impact cardio by July 22nd, easy run by July 28th, recovery good.\n    *   Old Knee Injury Warning: Occurred July 18th after strength training. Immediately stopped subsequent training that day, and adjusted plan via icing and consulting running friends. Affected subsequent days' leg weight-bearing training, but by avoiding risky movements, did not develop into acute injury, no discomfort reported after July 22nd.\n*   **Activity Break Events**:\n    *   July 8-9 break (2 days): Reason was significant mental/physical energy consumption for important machining task, plus mild physical discomfort. No performance decline reported upon return (July 10th).\n    *   July 16-17 break (2 days): Direct reason was plantar fasciitis recovery need. Post-break, used elliptical for adaptive recovery, did not affect aerobic capacity.\n*   **Health Metric Spike Events**:\n    *   Weight Sudden Increase: July 11th weight rose from 71.0kg to 71.4kg (+0.6kg). Reason was emotional eating due to pre-exam anxiety. Subsequently, through post-exam stress release, resuming regular activity and diet, returned to 71.2kg within 4 days (by July 15th) and continued to decline.\n*   **Lifestyle Rhythm Anomaly Events**:\n    *   Late Nights & Dense Social Periods: July 10-12 (around exam), July 25-27 (promotion celebration & moving). Bedtimes generally after 00:30 during these periods, average daily sleep duration compressed to 5-6 hours. Short-term led to fatigue accumulation, but you adjusted state relatively quickly through subsequent sleep catch-up (e.g., July 6th, 14th early bedtimes) and active physical activity (moving, exercise), with no sustained negative impact on end-month health.",

Increased 62.5% vs. previous week, following training plan.\n    *   **Week 3 (8/11-8/17):** Maintained peak and pushed for final effort, running ~60 km, completed ultimate 30km long run. Exercise performance peaked.\n    *   **Week 4 (8/18-8/24):** Entered taper period, running volume sharply decreased to ~25 km, down 58.3% vs. previous week, aimed at promoting recovery.\n    *   **Week 5 (8/25-8/31):** Pre-race adjustment and race week, running volume ~50 km (including half marathon race), intensity decreased then increased.\n*   **Training Cycle Peaks/Troughs:**\n    *   **Peak Week:** Week 3 (8/11-8/17). Performance evidenced by successful completion of the 30km long run with stable pace, physical capacity reached its peak.\n    *   **Trough Week:** No significant performance trough. Week 4 was planned tapering, not performance decline.\n*   **Exercise Performance Changes:** Running average pace gradually improved from ~5'35\"/km in Week 1 to 5'05\"/km in Week 3 simulation run, and speed sensation was maintained during taper (Weeks 4 & 5) via short pace runs. Pace improvement directly correlated with periodized training load arrangement and physical adaptation.\n\n#### **3.2 Health Trends**\n*   **Sleep Trends:** Weeks 2 & 3, despite sufficient sleep duration, deep sleep demand was high due to large training volume; Week 4 post-taper, sleep quality (especially deep sleep proportion) significantly improved. Monthly sleep continuity was good without frequent interruptions.\n*   **Physical Health Trends:** Weight and estimated body fat percentage showed a slow declining trend throughout the main training period (Weeks 1-3), plateaued slightly in Week 4 taper due to body water fluctuations. Resting heart rate and HRV showed a clear \"fatigue-recovery\" correlation: Week 3 with highest training load had higher resting HR and lower HRV; Week 4 post-taper saw decreased resting HR and significantly rebounded HRV.\n*   **Mental Health Trends:** Stress levels were generally stable, with only slight fluctuations during task-oriented work (Week 3 guiding new colleague, handling card replacement) and pre-race (Week 5). Mood noticeably improved after achieving goal milestones (salary increase, race completion) and social activities. Data indicates regular exercise and planned socializing are effective ways to maintain good mental state.\n*   **Injury Impact:** No major injury events this month. Only on August 11th, feeling calf fatigue, proactively adjusted running to strength training, effectively preventing potential injury.\n\n#### **3.3 Life Rhythm Trends**\n*   **Sleep/Wake & Mental State:** Data shows that when bedtime was after 23:30 (e.g., August 19th, 22nd, 23rd), next morning mental state and exercise willingness slightly decreased. Conversely, maintaining early sleep (before 22:30) during taper period led to noticeably higher perceived energy levels the next day.\n*   **Work/Life Rhythm Changes:** Week 3 added \"guiding new colleague\" to work role, bringing new responsibility and learning, indirectly boosting job satisfaction and positively impacting psychology. Increased social activities towards month-end (KTV, night fishing) served as pre-race stress relief, effectively balancing the tense preparation atmosphere.\n\n---\n\n### **Module 4: Personalized Insights**\n\n*   **Sleep ↔ Exercise Performance:** Data indicates that on days following a night with over 7 hours of sleep, particularly deep sleep over 1.5 hours, your aerobic training (tempo runs, long runs) pace stability improved by ~3% and perceived exertion decreased. Conversely, the night after the 30km run (August 18th), despite earlier bedtime, deep sleep demand was extremely high, and extreme fatigue was still felt the next day.\n*   **Business Trip/Stress ↔ Health:** The brief camping trip (August 16th-17th) had minimal impact on health metrics. Outdoor activity replaced running, resting heart rate remained stable, HRV did not drop, proving moderate-intensity outdoor activity is effective active recovery. Work stress (e.g., guiding new colleague, technical discussions) did not worsen health metrics, instead stimulated learning and sense of achievement, demonstrating good stress transformation ability.\n*   **Exercise Type ↔ Physical State:** **Running** is your core method for improving cardiovascular fitness and weight control; monthly running volume exceeding 200 km directly correlates with 0.5kg weight loss. **Strength training** (though only 3 sessions) played a key role in injury prevention (August 11th proactive adjustment) and improving running economy. **Hiking/Fishing** as low-intensity outdoor activities are effective methods for psychological relaxation and social connection.\n*   **Behavioral Habits ↔ Overall Health:** **Strong planning ability** (e.g., setting nutritional framework, daily pre-race plans, financial budgeting) is the core non-exercise factor for your successful half marathon achievement this month. It reduced anxiety from uncertainty and ensured discipline in training and recovery. **Pragmatic financial actions** (directed savings immediately after salary increase) brought significant psychological security and goal advancement feeling, indirectly stabilizing mood and health behaviors.\n\n---\n\n### **Module 5: Anomaly Event Summary**\n\n*   **Exercise Break Events:**\n    *   **Break Time:** August 6th.\n    *   **Break Reason:** Handling personal bank card replacement affairs, time conflict.\n    *   **Impact & Recovery:** Led to cancellation of that day's training plan, but had no impact on the overall training cycle; normal tempo run training resumed the next day (August 7th).\n*   **Health Metric Anomaly Events:**\n    *   **Anomalous Metric:** Weight.\n    *   **Anomaly Time & Magnitude:** August 23rd, weight increased from 70.5kg to 70.6kg (+0.1kg), August 28th 70.2kg.\n    *   **Anomaly Reason:** Evening gathering on August 22nd may have caused temporary water/sodium retention and increased caloric intake.\n    *   **Subsequent Change:** Weight quickly returned to its downward trend in subsequent days through normal diet and pre-race adjustment, not affecting race condition.\n*   **Life Rhythm Anomaly Events:**\n    *   **Anomaly Period:** Evening of August 19th.\n    *   **Anomaly Type:** Unexpected overtime leading to late sleep (23:45).\n    *   **Impact on Health/Exercise:** The next day (August 20th) was a planned taper day with no high-intensity exercise scheduled, thus no direct impact on exercise performance, but may have slightly affected that day's mental recovery speed.\n    *   **Recovery Measures & Effect:** Strictly adhered to early sleep plan for taper period in following days, sleep duration and quality quickly recovered.\n    *   **Anomaly Period:** August 28th.\n    *   **Anomaly Type:** Mild cold symptoms appeared (nasal congestion, dry throat).\n    *   **Impact on Health/Exercise:** May have slightly affected bodily sensations in the final pre-race days, but did not cause significant discomfort.\n    *   **Recovery Measures & Effect:** Symptoms largely disappeared within 1-2 days by proactively increasing water intake and ensuring rest, with no impact on the race.",

Highest day (Sep 26, enrolling and planning course) ~6 hours; lowest days (camping days) ~1 hour.\n    *   Dietary Habits: High regularity of three meals, ~25 days regular. Diet structure adjusted pre-race to high-protein, high-complex-carb; post-race and daily diet leaned towards balanced. Estimated ~12 meals from takeout/eating out this month, ~18 home-cooked meals. Estimated average daily water intake ~1.8-2.2 liters.\n\n**Monthly Trend Analysis**\n\n**3.1 Activity Trends**\n*   **Weekly Activity Volume Changes**:\n    *   Weeks 1-2 (Sep 1-13): Activity volume climbed weekly, being the pre-race taper and peak week. Week 2 had the longest running distance (including 15km pace run) and highest total activity duration, increasing ~35% week-over-week, due to final race preparation.\n    *   Week 3 (Sep 14-20): Activity volume dropped sharply, decreasing ~70% week-over-week. Core event was the half-marathon race (14th), followed by active recovery period, with activity focused on rest and light movement.\n    *   Week 4 (Sep 21-30): Activity volume slowly rebounded from low levels, increasing ~50% week-over-week. Resumed regular morning runs, but frequency and distance did not return to pre-race levels, while incorporating new kayaking experience.\n*   **Training Cycle Peaks/Valleys**:\n    *   Performance Peak Week: **Week 2**. Best perceived running state (Sep 4th), and completed high-quality pre-race long-distance pace run, reaching peak physical and mental readiness.\n    *   Valley Week: **Week 3**. Post-half-marathon, body in deep recovery phase, activity performance aimed at recovery with no intensity demands.\n*   **Performance Changes**: Running pace showed an upward trend in the two weeks before the race (Weeks 1-2), peaking in Week 2. Post-race (Weeks 3-4), pace training gave way to recovery jogs, with stable heart rate, indicating active adaptation and repair.\n\n**3.2 Health Trends**\n*   **Sleep Trends**: Week 2 saw slightly later bedtimes and average sleep continuity due to pre-race excitement and arrangements. Week 3 post-race had sufficient sleep duration, with deep sleep percentage estimated as the highest for the month, indicating strong body repair needs. Late Week 4 saw occasional late nights due to study focus, slightly shortening sleep duration.\n*   **Physical Health Trends**: Weight curve showed a \"V\" shape: slow pre-race decline (to 69.8kg), rapid post-race recovery and stabilization around 71kg. Resting Heart Rate and HRV showed coordinated changes: lower RHR and higher HRV during post-race recovery and after camping; the opposite during high work/study intensity.\n*   **Mental Health Trends**: Stress curve highly correlated with key events: peaks before the race and at important work nodes; troughs after race completion, during friend gatherings, and outdoor camping. Data shows high-quality social and outdoor activities significantly alleviate stress.\n*   **Injury Impact**: Experienced typical post-half-marathon Delayed Onset Muscle Soreness (DOMS) from Sep 15-18. This led to a complete halt in running Week 3, with low-intensity recovery runs early Week 4. Soreness largely disappeared around Sep 22, with full functional recovery.\n\n**3.3 Life Rhythm Trends**\n*   **Routine & Mental State**: Data shows that on days following bedtimes after 23:30 (e.g., Sep 6, 25), the keyword \"fatigue\" appeared in self-descriptions, and work planning or willingness for high-intensity activity decreased that day.\n    *   **Work/Life Rhythm Changes**: Weeks 2 and 4 involved challenging work tasks like training newcomers and high-precision machining, increasing work intensity. Activity time was partially compressed during these periods, but life order was maintained through lunch break planning and evening study. Weekend camping activities in Weeks 3 and 4 effectively offset mental work fatigue, bringing positive mood and physical relaxation.\n\n**Personalized Insights**\n\n*   **Sleep ↔ Activity Performance**: Data shows that on days following pre-race dinners adjusted to easily digestible foods (e.g., steamed eggs, tofu on Sep 9), self-reported sleep quality was better, and subsequent morning runs felt \"refreshed\". Inverse correlation: After a single day of high-intensity activity (half-marathon) or late-night study (e.g., Sep 25), although sleep duration might increase the next day, the speed of energy recovery slowed.\n*   **Travel/Pressure ↔ Health**: Although no business travel, work challenge events (e.g., high-precision machining) serve as pressure samples. Analysis found that during high-demand work tasks, Yin Hao's resting heart rate showed a slight upward trend, while he proactively adjusted his diet (lighter) to ensure energy, demonstrating awareness of buffering work pressure's impact on health through behavior management.\n*   **Activity Type ↔ Physical State**: Comparison reveals that towards the end of a single running training cycle (pre-race), localized fatigue accumulated. After incorporating cross-training like kayaking (Sep 21), the body felt \"different exercise enjoyment\" and considered it beneficial for running. This suggests introducing diverse activities helps alleviate repetitive strain and enhances overall exercise enjoyment.\n*   **Behavioral Habits ↔ Overall Health**: Data shows that when Yin Hao engages in detailed planning (e.g., pre-race diet/training plan, career learning plan) and execution, keywords like \"steady\", \"orderly\", \"satisfied\" appear most frequently, and his estimated health score is also high.

Diet structure leans towards high protein (increased fish, chicken breast), moderate carbs (brown rice, oats). Takeout meals ~5-6 times, home-cooked meals dominant. Estimated daily water intake 1.5-2L.\n\n**Monthly Trend Analysis**\n\n**3.1 Exercise Trends**\n*   **Weekly Exercise Volume Change**:\n    *   Week 1 (1st-6th): 2 exercise sessions (running 15km), moderate volume focused on family activities and planning.\n    *   Week 2 (7th-13th): 4 exercise sessions (running, strength), volume increased 40%, due to post-holiday training resumption and added strength training.\n    *   Week 3 (14th-20th): Exercise volume sharply dropped 80%, only 1 recovery run (2km), core event being injury on 15th causing training interruption.\n    *   Weeks 4-5 (21st-31st): Exercise volume gradually recovered, total 6 sessions (running, swimming), average weekly running distance progressively increased from 2km to 6km, reflecting scientific recovery principles.\n*   **Training Cycle Peaks/Valleys**:\n    *   **Peak Week**: Week 2, optimal combination of exercise frequency and types, including completion of a 15km long run.\n    *   **Valley Week**: Week 3, exercise nearly halted due to injury, accompanied by short-term weight gain.\n*   **Exercise Performance Change**: Running performance shows a \"peak-interruption-gradual recovery\" curve. Week 2 was the performance peak (completed long distance), Week 3 the valley (injury), from Week 4 pace became conservative, focusing on steady increases in distance and duration, indicating a shift in training focus from \"intensity\" to \"injury-free recovery and foundation building\".\n\n**3.2 Health Trends**\n*   **Sleep Trends**: Weeks 1-2 sleep was regular and stable; Week 3 sleep duration and quality declined due to stress, injury concerns, and late-night studying; after Week 4, as injury improved and task-related stress decreased, sleep regularity recovered. Sleep disruptions were highly correlated with stressful events.\n*   **Physical Health Trends**:\n    *   Weight showed a \"decrease-increase-decrease\" trend: slow decrease at month start, short-term increase post-injury due to reduced activity and camping diet, then continuous decrease to month-end low point with resumed training and dietary control.\n    *   Body fat percentage trend largely synchronized with weight.\n    *   Resting Heart Rate & HRV (Estimate): Negatively correlated with stress and injury status, likely worsened in Week 3, gradually improved after Week 4.\n*   **Mental Health Trends**: Stress levels rose at the end of Week 2 (start of mentoring), peaked at the beginning of Week 3 (injury), then gradually eased with recovery progress and task completion. Mood strongly correlated with exercise performance, social quality, and career feedback, reaching its best state by month-end.\n*   **Injury Impact**: Ankle tendinitis on the 15th directly caused a 10-day pause in subsequent running training, prompted a complete adjustment of the training plan, and raised awareness of the importance of proper warm-up, stretching, and cross-training.\n\n**3.3 Life Rhythm Trends**\n*   **Sleep/Wake & Mental State**: Data shows that on days following sleep after 23:30 (e.g., 14th, 17th, 27th), self-described \"fatigue\" increased, potentially affecting work efficiency or study focus. During periods of regular early sleep (e.g., month-end), mental state was generally described as \"energetic\", \"peaceful\".\n*   **Work/Life Rhythm Changes**: Work intensity increased in Week 3 due to mentoring tasks and sudden overtime, coinciding with life rhythm disruption from injury, the combination creating short-term health pressure. After Week 4, work entered a new normal (mentoring concluded), life rhythm was proactively adjusted (planned studying, scientific training), forming a positive cycle.\n\n**Personalized Insights**\n\n*   **Sleep ↔ Exercise Performance**: Data shows that during low-stress, regular sleep cycles (e.g., end of Week 4), your running distance could steadily increase without discomfort; conversely, at the end of a cycle with accumulated stress and slightly later sleep (end of Week 2), you performed a high-intensity interval run and got injured. This suggests **insufficient sleep or stress periods may reduce the body's tolerance for high-intensity training, increasing injury risk**.\n*   **Travel/Stress ↔ Health**: Short family trips (low-stress travel) positively impacted health (mood boost, activity variety). Work stress events (mentoring, overtime) were clearly associated with health indicator fluctuations: **During weeks with new mentoring tasks and overtime, your weight entered a plateau or slight increase phase, estimated resting heart rate rose, and a sports injury occurred**, indicating reduced recovery capacity during high-pressure periods.\n*   **Exercise Type ↔ Physical State**: Comparison reveals that **injury occurred at the end of a period of single-type running training (especially intensity-focused); after introducing strength training (Week 2), no immediate issues arose, but accumulated fatigue may not have been fully relieved**. Introducing swimming cross-training at month-end yielded positive physical feedback. This indicates **exercise diversity plays a positive role in injury prevention and promoting overall health**.\n*   **Behavioral Habits ↔ Overall Health**: Your data clearly shows that **when \"regular sleep schedule\", \"self-prepared healthy meals\", and \"progressive exercise\" are synchronized (e.g., Week 4), the weight loss trend is most evident and emotional state is optimal**. Conversely, disruption in any one area (e.g., injury, increased eating out in Week 3) hinders health progress. Furthermore, **career growth and learning investment (e.g., attending meetings, enrolling for electrician certification) significantly boosted your sense of achievement and mental health score**.\n\n**Abnormal Event Summary**\n\n1.  **Injury Event**:\n    *   **Event**: Mild tendinitis in the right ankle.\n    *   **Time**: Occurred during morning run on Oct 15th.\n    *   **Impact**: Directly caused a pause in running training from Oct 16th to 25th, replaced by daily icing and rehabilitation stretching; disrupted original half-marathon preparation rhythm; caused short-term weight gain and estimated resting heart rate increase.\n    *   **Recovery**: Attempted a 2km recovery run starting Oct 21st, thereafter cautiously increased distance. By Oct 31st, able to complete a 6km easy run and attempt swimming cross-training with no ankle discomfort, indicating good recovery.\n2.  **Exercise Break Event**:\n    *   **Event**: Exercise break due to injury.\n    *   **Time Period & Duration**: Oct 16th to 25th, lasting 10 days.\n    *   **Cause**: Right ankle tendinitis requiring rest and recovery.\n    *   **Post-Break Recovery Performance**: Initial recovery runs (21st) were extremely slow-paced and short-distance, focusing on body feedback. Subsequently, running volume and distance increased steadily and slowly over the next week without causing pain again, indicating a scientifically effective recovery strategy.\n3.  **Health Indicator Fluctuation Event**:\n    *   **Event**: Short-term sharp weight increase.\n    *   **Indicator & Time**: Weight, between Oct 15th and 18th, increased from 71.5kg to 72.1kg.\n    *   **Fluctuation Magnitude**: +0.6kg.\n    *   **Fluctuation Cause**: Primarily due to a sharp drop in activity post-injury, possibly accompanied by inflammatory edema, and relaxed diet during camping on 18th-19th.\n    *   **Subsequent Change**: Starting Oct 20th, through dietary control and gradual resumption of activity, weight entered a downward trend, dropping to 70.5kg by month-end.\n4.  **Life Rhythm Anomaly Event**:\n    *   **Event**: Short-term sleep schedule disruption due to work/study pressure.\n    *   **Anomaly Periods**: Oct 13th, 17th, 26th.\n    *   **Anomaly Type**: Late sleep (after 23:30, latest until 00:30).\n    *   **Impact on Health/Exercise**: Next-day mental state self-described as \"slightly fatigued\", \"slightly sleepy\", potentially affecting daytime work efficiency and exercise performance. Temporally associated with the sports injury on the 15th.\n    *   **Recovery Measures & Effect**: Proactive adjustments after events, e.g., planning study time on 27th to avoid encroaching on sleep, restored regular sleep schedule by month-end, with sleep duration and quality recovering.",

Interval attempt on 12th led to strain, followed by active reduction, demonstrating flexible adjustment.\n        *   Week 3 (15th-21st): Activity volume reduced due to strain recovery and cold, focused on low-intensity recovery and stretching.\n        *   Week 4 (22nd-30th): Activity volume recovered and peaked, high running frequency, completed month-end run. Performance recovered to pre-injury levels.\n    *   **Training Cycle Peaks/Valleys**:\n        *   **Peak Week**: Week 4, high activity frequency, significant weight management results, high mental energy.\n        *   **Valley Week**: Week 3, lowest activity volume and intensity for the month due to combined strain and cold.\n    *   **Performance Changes**: Running pace fluctuated due to weather (low temp, wind) and physical state (strain, fatigue), but endurance continuously improved (single-run distance stabilized from 8km to attempting 9km). Ability to complete target mileage in low temps during Week 4 demonstrates enhanced stress resistance.\n*   **3.2 Health Trends**\n    *   **Sleep Trend**: Weekly sleep duration and quality directly influenced by **work schedule**. Week 1 night shifts caused sleep deprivation; Weeks 2-4 saw stable duration and quality recovery after returning to day shifts. Weekend catch-up sleep mechanism was effective.\n    *   **Physical Health Trend**: Weight showed a \"W-shaped\" fluctuation: Week 1 stable → Week 2 slight rise post-night shifts → Week 3 peak from social dinners → Week 4 steady decline to monthly low after strict control. Trend shows strong monitoring and intervention capability regarding weight.\n    *   **Mental Health Trend**: Stress levels strongly correlated with **work/study task density**. Positive mood correlated with **social feedback** (e.g., camping recognition, good news from friends, family support, work excellence) and **goal progress** (home purchase research, study progress).\n    *   **Injury Impact**: Right calf strain on 12th directly affected Week 3 activity schedule, shifting to low-intensity recovery. Through rest, ice, stretching, fully recovered by Week 4, without impacting core monthly running goals.\n*   **3.3 Lifestyle Rhythm Trends**\n    *   **Routine & Mental State**: When bedtime was after 23:30 (e.g., 17th, 26th), the next morning's run felt more effortful. On days ensuring sleep before 23:00, work and study focus were higher the next day.\n    *   **Work/Life Rhythm Changes**: Emergency night shifts in Week 1 and concurrent new equipment training/home purchase plan in Weeks 3-4 were the two main periods of life rhythm tension. You balanced these through **strict time management** (e.g., using lunch break for loan calculations, fixed evening study time) and **proactive social relaxation** (camping, gatherings), resulting in an overall smooth transition.\n\n**Module 4: Personalized Insights**\n*   **Sleep ↔ Performance**: Data shows that when you maintain a regular day-shift routine (bedtime no later than 23:30), the completion rate and subjective ease of the next morning's run reach 100%. Conversely, after night shifts or late nights, even if the run is completed, pace spontaneously slows by ~0'20\"-0'30\"/km, and the body starts up slower.\n*   **Work Pressure ↔ Health**: Although no long business trips, **emergency night shifts** as a high-intensity work stress event led to three consecutive days of sleep deprivation, during which weight slightly increased (+0.3kg) and recovery run pace decreased. This indicates that acute work stress has a noticeable impact on short-term physical recovery and metabolism.\n*   **Activity Type ↔ Physical State**: Comparison reveals that in weeks with **at least one non-running cross-training session or outdoor hobby** (e.g., cycling, swimming, fishing), your mood score (inferred from descriptions) was higher, and perceived risk of exercise injury was lower. Fishing, as a low-intensity outdoor activity, was particularly effective in alleviating work-related mental fatigue.\n*   **Behavioral Patterns ↔ Overall Health**: Data indicates that **\"combining high-intensity work periods with clear social/leisure plans\"** is an effective pattern for you to maintain psychological balance. Examples: planning camping after night shifts (8th), arranging friend gatherings during training pressure (14th, 15th). This planned relaxation effectively counters stress and prevents burnout. Additionally, **\"breaking down large goals into weekly executable small tasks\"** (e.g., studying fixed chapters weekly, researching one home purchase area weekly) is key to your ability to maintain multi-threaded progress with a strong sense of achievement.\n\n**Module 5: Anomaly Event Summary**\n*   **Injury Event**:\n    *   **Occurrence Time**: Afternoon of November 12th.\n    *   **Injury Type**: Minor right calf muscle strain.\n    *   **Impact Scope**: Led to pausing running plans from 12th-14th, switching to home rest and light stretching.\n    *   **Recovery Status**: After 3 days of rest and subsequent gentle stretching, low-intensity activity resumed on 15th, with no discomfort during morning run by 18th, fully resumed regular training after 22nd. No secondary injury occurred during recovery.\n*   **Activity Break Event**:\n    *   **Break Period**: November 12th - November 14th.\n    *   **Duration**: 3 days.\n    *   **Break Cause**: Active rest strategy adopted due to right calf strain from insufficient warm-up for interval training.\n    *   **Post-Break Recovery Performance**: Gentle stretching on 15th, cautious pace upon running resumption on 16th, fully normal training rhythm restored after 18th. Break did not impact monthly exercise habit.\n*   **Health Metric Fluctuation Event**:\n    *   **Fluctuating Metric**: Weight.\n    *   **Fluctuation Time**: November 19th - 20th.\n    *   **Fluctuation Magnitude**: Increased from 71.1kg to 71.3kg, a gain of 0.2kg.\n    *   **Fluctuation Cause**: Consecutive social dinners over two nights, exceeding daily caloric intake.\n    *   **Subsequent Change**: Upon awareness, immediate diet control was implemented, combined with exercise from 21st-24th, leading to steady weight decline, reaching the monthly low of 70.0kg by the 30th.\n*   **Lifestyle Rhythm Anomaly Event**:\n    *   **Anomaly Period**: November 3rd - November 6th.\n    *   **Anomaly Type**: Consecutive night shifts due to emergency production tasks, causing circadian reversal.\n    *   **Impact on Health/Activity**: Average daily sleep reduced to 5-6 hours with poor quality. Morning runs were maintained but pace decreased and subjective fatigue increased.\n    *   **Recovery Measures & Effect**: After night shifts ended, utilized the weekend (7th-9th) for social leisure activities (camping, dinners, karaoke) and catch-up sleep. By the 10th, routine and mental state had fully returned to normal day-shift rhythm.",

Average duration per session: 20 minutes.\n        *   **Core Exercise Completion Volume:** Plank approx. 24 sets total, Crunches approx. 36 sets total, Russian Twists approx. 24 sets total.\n*   **Exercise Habit Preferences:**\n    *   **High-Frequency Exercise Days:** Saturday (5 sessions), Tuesday/Thursday (4 sessions each).\n    *   **High-Frequency Exercise Times:** Morning (6:00-7:30, 58.3%), mainly for morning runs; Evening (20:00-21:00, 33.3%), mainly for core training.\n    *   **Exercise Locations:** Songjiang Sports Center indoor track (5 times), Guangfulin Road and surrounding neighborhood (4 times), Living room at home (8 times), Other (fishing, garage, etc., 7 times).\n    *   **Exercise Consistency:**\n        *   **Longest Consecutive Exercise Days:** 5 days (Dec 27-31).\n        *   **Exercise Gaps:** 3 noticeable gaps of 1-2 days each occurred this month. Reasons: Cold wave/physical discomfort (16th, 22nd), socializing/staying up late the previous night (25th).\n\n#### **2.2 Health Review**\n*   **Sleep:**\n    *   **Average Daily Sleep Duration:** Weekdays approx. 6.8 hours, weekends approx. 7.5 hours.\n    *   **Sleep Stage Distribution:** No wearable device data. Based on inferred routine, deep sleep percentage likely stable due to regular exercise, but light sleep may have increased during high-pressure period (latter half).\n    *   **Sleep Schedule Stability:** Weekday bedtime fluctuated between 22:45-23:45, a variation of 60 minutes; wake-up time fluctuated between 06:20-07:00, relatively stable. Weekend schedule shifted approx. 1 hour later.\n    *   **Sleep Interruptions:** No records. Overall sleep quality presumed acceptable, but sleep may have become lighter during stress periods.\n*   **Physiological Indicators:**\n    *   **Weight:** Starting 70.0kg, month-end 70.5kg, monthly average approx. 70.8kg. **Maximum fluctuation** was 1.5kg (reached 71.5kg on Dec 20th due to dining out and company year-end party meals), overall trend showing \"mid-month peak, late-month decline.\"\n    *   **Body Fat Percentage:** No specific data. Inferred from physical exam's \"fatty liver tendency\" and late-month weight decline trend that body fat percentage may have slightly decreased by month-end.\n    *   **Resting Heart Rate:** No device data. Based on fast post-exercise recovery (physical exam description) and ISTJ personality, resting heart rate likely in low-medium range (e.g., 60-65 bpm), possibly briefly elevated during work stress periods.\n    *   **HRV (Heart Rate Variability):** No data. Likely higher during regular exercise periods, possibly briefly lowered after high work pressure and social drinking (14th, 19th, 24th).\n*   **Mental Health:**\n    *   **Stress:** **Average daily stress level medium-low, but with distinct peaks.** High-stress period was Dec 22-26, stress level up to 7/10 (on a 10-point scale), source being the \"machining chatter technical challenge.\" Stress significantly reduced on Dec 10th and 19th due to professional recognition and financial benefits.\n    *   **Mood:** **Predominant moods were \"calm\" and \"fulfilled.\"** Mood fluctuations: Early month \"anticipation\" and \"contemplation\" due to exam results and learning new knowledge; Mid-month \"warmth\" and \"satisfaction\" from house viewing and socializing; Late month \"anxiety\" and \"frustration\" due to technical challenge, turning into \"sense of accomplishment\" and \"relief\" after problem resolution.\n    *   **Health Score:** No quantitative score. Subjective health perception followed an upward curve from \"confirmation of good health\" early month, to \"proactive optimization\" mid-month, to \"steady and positive\" by month-end.\n\n#### **2.3 Life Rhythm Review**\n*   **Sleep/Wake Habits:**\n    *   **Average Daily Routine:** Weekdays bedtime approx. 23:15, wake-up approx. 06:40; Weekends bedtime approx. 23:20, wake-up approx. 07:45.\n    *   **Weekday vs. Weekend Difference:** Weekends average bedtime 5 minutes later than weekdays, but wake-up 65 minutes later, total sleep duration approx. 1 hour longer.\n    *   **Days with Disrupted Sleep Schedule:** 7 days with bedtime after 23:30, concentrated in weeks 3 and 4 (14th, 19th, 20th, 24th, 25th, 26th, 30th), reasons including wedding, year-end party, technical challenge, socializing, and year-end summary.\n*   **Commute/Activity:**\n    *   **Average Daily Non-Exercise Steps:** Estimated approx. 5000-7000 steps (based on manufacturing operator job nature). **Highest step week** likely week 1 (physical exam, skill assessment) and week 4 (increased technical challenge and workshop activity).\n    *   **Commute Mode:** Personal vehicle. **One-way distance** estimated approx. 8-10 km (within Songjiang District), **average daily commute time** approx. 40 minutes.\n    *   **Business Travel/Vacation:** None. However, a short fishing trip to Jiaxing on Dec 13th did not affect that day's exercise (morning run) and increased outdoor activity.\n*   **Daily Life:**\n    *   **Screen Time:** **Average daily screen time approx. 4-5 hours.** Work-related (electrician study, technical queries) approx. 2 hours, entertainment (mobile games, social media, videos) approx. 2-3 hours. **Highest screen time day** likely the 26th (forum posts for help, financial review), possibly exceeding 6 hours.\n    *   **Dietary Habits:**\n        *   **Meal Regularity:** Regular meals on approx. 26 days. Irregular on 5 days (2nd, 8th, 19th, 20th, 24th), mainly due to overtime and dining out.\n        *   **Diet Composition:** Preference for Shanghainese cuisine (braised pork, steamed fish), tendency for high oil/salt during dining out. Conscious effort to control alcohol consumption this month (responding to physical exam advice).\n        *   **Takeout/Homemade Meals:** Estimated takeout approx. 8-10 times, homemade meals approx. 20-22 times.\n        *   **Average Daily Water Intake:** No records. Based on exercise habits, inferred to be relatively sufficient.\n\n### **Module 3: Monthly Trend Analysis**\n\n#### **3.1 Exercise Trends**\n*   **Weekly Exercise Volume Changes:**\n    *   **Week 1 (1st-7th):** 5 sessions (Running 2, Core 0, Other 3). Mainly running and fishing, steady volume.\n    *   **Week 2 (8th-14th):** 6 sessions (Running 3, Core 1, Other 2). Running frequency recovered, and **core training introduced for the first time**.\n    *   **Week 3 (15th-21st):** 5 sessions (Running 2, Core 2, Other 1). Slight dip in exercise volume influenced by work pressure and initiation of technical issue, but core training adherence remained good.\n    *   **Week 4 (22nd-31st):** 8 sessions (Running 5, Core 5, Other -2). **Exercise volume reached monthly peak**, especially after technical challenge resolution (29th-31st), consecutive \"running + core\" composite training to release stress and solidify habits.\n*   **Training Cycle Peaks/Valleys:**\n    *   **Peak Week:** Week 4. Best exercise frequency and adherence, exercise performance (running mood, training completion) synchronized with positive mood.\n    *   **Valley Days:** December 22nd, 25th. Affected by work pressure, slight physical discomfort, and insufficient sleep the previous night, leading to consecutive morning run cancellations.\n*   **Exercise Performance Changes:**\n    *   Running pace and distance remained stable throughout the month, no significant improvement or decline, indicating purpose of maintaining habits and health.\n    *   Core training progressed from initial attempt on Dec 12th to 2 sessions per week in weeks 3 and 4, with weekly improvement in completion and physical adaptation.\n\n#### **3.2 Health Trends**\n*   **Sleep Trends:**\n    *   **Duration and Quality:** Sleep duration stable and quality high in weeks 1 and 2. **Sleep duration shortened and bedtime delayed in weeks 3 and 4**, especially during the technical challenge period (22nd-26th), average sleep duration reduced by approx. 0.5-1 hour.\n    *   **Fluctuation Causes:** Directly correlated with work pressure and social activities (wedding, year-end party, Christmas gathering).\n*   **Physical Health Trends:**\n    *   **Weight Change Curve:** Slow rise in weeks 1-2 (70.0→70.8kg), peak reached in week 3 at 71.5kg (year-end party), steady decline in week 4 to 70.5kg (stress relief, dietary and exercise control).\n    *   **Indicator Correlation:** **Weight changes highly correlated with social dining and work pressure cycles.** After pressure subsided/resolved, weight was effectively managed through resumed exercise and dietary control.\n*   **Mental Health Trends:**\n    *   **Stress Curve:** Stress level gentle in weeks 1-2; sharp rise in late week 3 (starting 22nd); rapid decline to low point by end of week 4 (starting 29th).\n    *   **Exercise and Mental Health Correlation:** Data shows **the period with the highest exercise frequency in week 4 was also the period with the fastest stress relief**, confirming exercise as an effective stress management tool for you.\n*   **Injury Impact:** No exercise-related injuries reported this month. \"Mild headache/cold symptoms\" recorded on Dec 1st, 11th, 22nd did not cause long-term impact on exercise, only leading to single-session plan adjustments.\n\n#### **3.3 Life Rhythm Trends**\n*   **Sleep Schedule and Mental State:** On days with bedtime after 23:30 (7 days total), the following day often had descriptions like \"tired,\" \"slightly fatigued,\" and directly led to morning run cancellations on the 22nd and 25th, indicating **delayed sleep schedule negatively impacts daytime energy and exercise execution**.\n*   **Work/Life Rhythm Changes:**\n    *   **Work Intensity Changes:** Late week 3 to early week 4 (Dec 22-26) was a **high-intensity work period**, involving tackling the technical challenge. Impact: Caused 2-day exercise gap, compressed sleep time, increased screen time (technical queries).\n    *   **Life Changes:** Weekends of weeks 2 and 3 (13th-14th, 20th-21st) involved dense social and personal activities like house viewing, wedding, winter fishing, which somewhat squeezed exercise regularity for those weeks but were maintained through flexible adjustments.\n\n### **Module 4: Personalized Insights**\n\n1.  **Sleep ↔ Exercise Performance:** Data shows **when your bedtime was before 23:15 (e.g., Dec 2, 7, 23, 29), the completion rate for morning runs or core training the next day was 100%.** When bedtime exceeded 23:45 (e.g., 20th, 24th, 26th), the probability of canceling exercise or switching to low-intensity activity the next day significantly increased.\n2.  **Work Pressure ↔ Health:** Although no business travel this month, **the high-intensity work pressure event (machining chatter challenge) produced a similar effect:** The approximately 5-day high-pressure period led to an average reduction of 0.8 hours in sleep duration, increased subjective fatigue, and directly caused a 2-day exercise gap. Health behaviors (exercise, regular sleep) quickly returned after pressure was resolved.\n3.  **Exercise Type ↔ Physical State:** **The introduction of core strength training was a key turning point in health behavior this month.** After starting bi-weekly core training (from week 2), despite weight fluctuations from dining out, you felt \"increased abdominal strength,\" and weight control effects became apparent by month-end. Simultaneously, strength training as a complement to running reduced potential overuse injury risk from a single activity.\n4.  **Behavioral Habits ↔ Overall Health:**\n    *   **Impact of Sleep Schedule Stability:** During weeks 1 and 2 with relatively regular sleep, your predominant moods were \"calm\" and \"fulfilled,\" with smooth progress in study and work plans. Increased sleep schedule fluctuations in weeks 3 and 4 overlapped with periods of anxiety and stress.\n    *   **Control of Social Dining:** After receiving physical exam advice this month, you consciously \"controlled alcohol\" and \"ate more steamed dishes\" during multiple dining out occasions (6th, 14th, 19th, 24th). **This conscious control allowed you to bring your weight back close to the starting level by month-end despite several dining out events**, demonstrating good self-management ability.\n    *   **Problem-Solving Pattern:** Faced with the technical challenge (chatter), you exhibited a complete ISTJ-style health coping chain: **\"Encounter pressure → Briefly affects sleep/exercise → Seek social support (mentor, colleagues) and external knowledge (forum) → Solve problem → Release stress through exercise, restore sleep schedule.\"** This pattern effectively prevented pressure from transforming into chronic health issues.\n\n### **Module 5: Anomaly Event Summary**\n\n1.  **Exercise Gap Events:**\n    *   **Event:** Consecutive planned exercise pauses.\n    *   **Time and Duration:** December 22nd, 25th, each a 1-day gap.\n    *   **Causes:** 22nd due to increased technical challenge pressure and slight physical discomfort; 25th due to fatigue from"
