**Monthly Trend Analysis**

**3.1 Activity Trends**
*   **Weekly Activity Volume Changes**:
    *   Week 1 (1st-7th): 4 sessions, mainly 5-6km regular runs, steady start.
    *   Week 2 (8th-14th): 3 sessions, included 15km breakthrough run, total distance increased significantly, but entered recovery due to foot discomfort.
    *   Week 3 (15th-21st): 3 sessions, running volume reduced, added elliptical cardio, recovery & adjustment week.
    *   Week 4 (22nd-31st): 7 sessions, highest frequency, running volume recovered, introduced swimming cross-training, overall performance rebounded.
*   **Training Cycle Peaks/Valleys**:
    *   Peak Week: Week 4. Activity frequency and diversity peaked, body recovered from injury, performance stable.
    *   Valley Week: Latter half of Week 2 (14th-17th). Running volume sharply reduced due to plantar fasciitis, forced deload period.
*   **Performance Changes**:
    *   Running pace stable early month and Week 4; temporarily declined post-long run Week 2 due to fatigue/injury; returned to normal Week 4 post-recovery. Training load and rest directly determined performance curve, reflecting timely injury response.

**3.2 Health Trends**
*   **Sleep Trends**:
    *   Weeks 1 & 2 sleep duration compressed by work stress & pre-exam anxiety, avg. below 7h. Week 3 sleep duration/quality rebounded post-exam. Week 4, despite social activities, overall relaxed mindset led to good sleep quality. Data shows stressful events are primary factor affecting sleep duration.
*   **Physical Health Trends**:
    *   Weight showed "stress up, relax down" trend: Peaked Week 2 exam period, steadily declined post-exam & Week 4 to monthly low.
    *   Resting Heart Rate and HRV showed opposite trends: High-stress period (W2) RHR increased, HRV decreased; Relaxation/recovery period (W4) RHR decreased, HRV increased.
*   **Mental Health Trends**:
    *   Stress peaked Week 2 (exam), then dropped rapidly. Positive emotions (achievement, joy) significantly enhanced Week 3 (post-exam), Week 4 (promotion, move). Activity became key positive mood regulator post-stress periods (e.g., W4).
*   **Injury Impact**:
    *   Plantar fasciitis (July 13th) directly affected Weeks 2 & 3 running plans, reducing volume and prompting low-impact cardio substitution.
    *   Old knee injury warning (July 18th) prompted immediate strength training adjustment, avoiding potential serious injury, demonstrating good self-health management.

**3.3 Life Rhythm Trends**
*   **Routine & Mental State**:
    *   On days following bedtime past 00:00 (e.g., July 8th, 12th), mental state described as "fatigued", affecting performance or leading to cancelled training.
*   **Work/Life Rhythm Changes**:
    *   Week 2 work intensity (exam prep, important tasks) and psychological stress peaked, squeezing both activity and sleep.
    *   Week 4 major life change (move) brought physical exertion, but accompanied by positive emotions from promotion, leading to overall improved health metrics.

**Personalized Insights**

*   **Sleep ↔ Performance**:
    *   Data shows, on days following sleep ≥7.5h and bedtime before 23:00 (e.g., July 6th, 22nd), your motivation and quality of activity execution were higher. Conversely, after staying up late (e.g., July 11th 00:30 bed), not only was no activity scheduled the next day, but it was accompanied by anxiety-driven eating.
*   **Stress/Life Events ↔ Health**:
    *   Key career milestones (exam, promotion) were core drivers of health fluctuations this month. Exam stress (W2) caused short-term weight increase of ~1.0%, RHR increase ~8%, and directly triggered activity-related injury. Successful stressful events (promotion) transformed into positive motivation, driving comprehensive improvement in activity volume and health metrics Week 4.
*   **Activity Type ↔ Physical State**:
    *   You practiced an active cross-training strategy this month. During foot discomfort, using elliptical (July 22nd) maintained cardio without aggravating injury. Introducing swimming late month (July 30th, 31st) as active recovery post-high-intensity running effectively promoted fatigue elimination.
*   **Behavioral Habits ↔ Overall Health**:
    *   Stable routine and home-cooked meals are the foundation of body fat management. During stress periods, disrupted routine and increased eating out jointly led to weight peak. When life returned to routine (e.g., W4), even with celebratory meals, weight steadily declined through increased activity expenditure and timely dietary adjustment. Your ISTJ traits, evident in creating/enforcing the "Shared Apartment Convention" and planning training/savings, provided a stable external framework for healthy living.

**Abnormal Event Summary**

*   **Injury Events**:
    *   Plantar Fasciitis: Occurred July 13th post-long run. Affected running training July 14-17, switched to low-intensity activity. Through icing, stretching, reduced load, recovered to low-impact cardio July 22nd, easy run July 28th. Good recovery.
    *   Old Knee Injury Warning: Occurred July 18th post-strength training. Immediately halted subsequent training that day, used icing, consulted running friends to adjust plan. Affected subsequent days' leg weight-bearing training, but by avoiding risky movements, did not develop into acute injury. No discomfort reported after July 22nd.
*   **Activity Break Events**:
    *   July 8-9 break (2 days): Reason was important machining task consuming significant mental/physical energy, plus mild physical discomfort. No reported performance drop upon return (July 10th).
    *   July 16-17 break (2 days): Direct reason was plantar fasciitis recovery need. Post-break, used elliptical for adaptive recovery, did not affect aerobic capacity.
*   **Health Metric Spike Event**:
    *   Sudden Weight Increase: July 11th weight rose from 71.0kg to 71.4kg (+0.6kg). Reason: anxiety-driven emotional eating pre-exam. Subsequently, through post-exam stress release, resuming regular activity/diet, returned to 71.2kg within 4 days (by July 15th) and continued declining.
*   **Life Rhythm Anomaly Events**:
    *   Late Nights & Intense Social Periods: July 10-12 (around exam), July 25-27 (promotion celebration & move). During these times, bedtime generally after 00:30, avg. daily sleep compressed to 5-6h. Short-term led to cumulative fatigue, but you adjusted state relatively quickly through subsequent sleep catch-up (e.g., July 6th, 14th early bed) and active physical exertion (moving, activity), with no lasting negative impact on end-month health.
