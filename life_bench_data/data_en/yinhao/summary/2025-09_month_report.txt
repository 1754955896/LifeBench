    *   Average Daily Sleep Duration: Weekdays ~6.5-7 hours, weekends ~7-8 hours.
    *   Sleep Stage Distribution (Estimate): Deep sleep ~20-25% (higher during post-race recovery), Light sleep ~55-60%, REM ~20%.
    *   Routine Stability: Weekday bedtime concentrated 22:30-23:30, wake-up time 5:50-6:30; Weekend bedtime more variable (22:00-00:45), wake-up delayed to 7:00-8:30. Monthly routine disruptions (sleeping after 00:00) ~5 days, due to pre-race excitement, friend gatherings, and study focus.

    *   Weight: Start of month 70.0kg, end of month 71.0kg. Weekly averages fluctuated between 70.0-71.3kg. Largest fluctuation occurred the morning after the half-marathon (Sep 15) at 69.8kg (post-race dehydration and expenditure), followed by rapid recovery. Overall trend was stable: "slight pre-race decrease, slight post-race recovery increase".

*   **Commute / Activity**:
    *   Average Daily Non-Exercise Steps: Estimate ~5000-7000 steps. Commute method: driving, one-way distance ~8 km, average daily commute time ~40 minutes.
    *   Business Travel/Trips: No business travel. Two weekend trips: ① Sep 13-14 Dianshan Lake camping (Impact on activity: increased outdoor activity; on sleep: slightly later routine but high quality; on diet: mainly BBQ, oilier than usual). ② Sep 20-21 second camping trip.

    *   Dietary Habits: High regularity for three meals, ~25 days regular. Diet structure adjusted pre-race to high-protein, high-complex carbs; post-race and daily leaned towards balanced. Monthly takeout/dining out ~12 times, home-cooked meals ~18 times. Estimated average daily water intake ~1.8-2.2 liters.

**Monthly Trend Analysis**

**3.1 Activity Trends**
*   **Weekly Activity Volume Changes**:
    *   Weeks 1-2 (Sep 1-13): Activity volume climbed weekly, being the pre-race taper and peak week. Week 2 had the longest running distance (including 15km pace run) and highest total activity duration, increasing ~35% week-over-week, due to final strengthening for the half-marathon.
    *   Week 3 (Sep 14-20): Activity volume dropped sharply, decreasing ~70% week-over-week. Core event was the half-marathon race (14th), followed by an active recovery period with rest and light activity.
    *   Week 4 (Sep 21-30): Activity volume slowly recovered from low levels, increasing ~50% week-over-week. Resumed regular morning runs, but frequency and distance did not return to pre-race levels, while incorporating new kayaking experience.
*   **Training Cycle Peaks/Valleys**:
    *   Performance Peak Week: **Week 2**. Best perceived running state (Sep 4th), completed high-quality pre-race long-distance pace run, physical and mental preparation peaked.
    *   Valley Week: **Week 3**. Post half-marathon, body in deep recovery phase, activity performance focused on recovery, no intensity demands.
*   **Performance Changes**: Running pace showed an upward trend in the two weeks pre-race (Weeks 1-2), peaking in Week 2. Post-race (Weeks 3-4), pace training gave way to recovery jogs, heart rate remained stable, indicating active adaptation and repair.

**3.2 Health Trends**
*   **Sleep Trends**: Week 2 bedtime slightly delayed due to pre-race excitement and arrangements, sleep continuity average. Week 3 post-race, sleep duration sufficient, deep sleep % estimated highest for the month, strong body repair demand. Late Week 4, occasional late nights due to study focus slightly shortened sleep duration.
*   **Physical Health Trends**: Weight curve showed a "V" shape: slow pre-race decline (to 69.8kg), rapid post-race recovery and stabilization around 71kg. Resting Heart Rate and HRV showed coordinated changes: post-race recovery and after camping, RHR lower, HRV higher; opposite during high work/study intensity.
*   **Mental Health Trends**: Stress curve highly correlated with key events: peaks before race, during important work nodes; troughs after race completion, friend gatherings, outdoor camping. Data shows high-quality social and outdoor activities significantly alleviate stress.
*   **Injury Impact**: Sep 15-18, experienced typical post-half-marathon Delayed Onset Muscle Soreness (DOMS). Resulted in complete running cessation Week 3, early Week 4 focused on low-intensity recovery runs. By around Sep 22, soreness largely disappeared, motor function fully recovered.

**3.3 Life Rhythm Trends**
*   **Routine & Mental State**: Data shows that on days following bedtime after 23:30 (e.g., Sep 6, 25), the keyword "fatigue" appeared in self-descriptions, and work planning or willingness for high-intensity activity decreased that day.
*   **Work/Life Rhythm Changes**: Weeks 2 & 4 involved challenging work tasks like training newcomers, high-precision machining, increasing work intensity. Activity time was partially compressed during these periods, but life order was maintained through lunch break planning, evening study, etc. Weekend camping activities in Weeks 3 & 4 effectively offset mental work fatigue, bringing positive mood and physical relaxation.

**Personalized Insights**

*   **Sleep ↔ Activity Performance**: Data shows that on days following pre-race dinners adjusted to easily digestible foods (e.g., Sep 9 steamed eggs, tofu), self-reported sleep quality was better, and subsequent morning runs felt "refreshed". Reverse correlation: After single-day high-intensity events (half-marathon) or late-night study (e.g., Sep 25), although next-day sleep duration might increase, energy recovery speed slowed.
*   **Travel/Pressure ↔ Health**: Although no business travel, work challenge events (e.g., high-precision machining) serve as pressure samples. Analysis found that during high-demand work tasks, Yin Hao's resting heart rate showed a slight upward trend, while he proactively adjusted diet (lighter) to ensure energy, demonstrating awareness of buffering work pressure's impact on health through behavior management.
*   **Activity Type ↔ Physical State**: Comparison shows that towards the end of a single-type (running) training cycle (pre-race), localized fatigue accumulated. After incorporating cross-training like kayaking (Sep 21), the body felt "different exercise enjoyment" and considered it beneficial for running. This suggests introducing diverse activities helps alleviate repetitive strain and enhances overall exercise enjoyment.
*   **Behavioral Habits ↔ Overall Health**: Data shows that when Yin Hao conducted detailed planning (e.g., pre-race diet/training plan, career learning plan) and executed it, keywords like "steady", "orderly", "satisfied" appeared most frequently, and health score (estimate) was also high. This confirms the positive correlation between the "planning" trait in his ISTJ personality and mental health/overall sense of efficacy.

**Abnormal Event Summary**

*   **Injury Events**:
    *   Event: Post-race Delayed Onset Muscle Soreness (DOMS).
    *   Time: Started Sep 15, lasted ~3-4 days.
    *   Impact: Led to running pause Sep 15-17, only stretching/relaxation; distance and pace significantly reduced during recovery jog on Sep 18.
