        *   Dietary habits: High regularity of three meals (~25 days regular), diet structure leans towards home-cooked and high-protein (braised pork, fish). Low frequency of takeout, frequent homemade lunches (e.g., 4th). Social dinners ~5 times, main cause of weight fluctuations. Daily water intake (inferred) sufficient, ~1.5-2L.

**Module 3: Monthly Trend Analysis**
*   **3.1 Activity Trends**
    *   **Weekly Activity Volume Changes**:
        *   Week 1 (1st-7th): Moderate activity volume, including running, swimming, fishing. Experienced night shifts but maintained morning runs, demonstrating resilience.
        *   Week 2 (8th-14th): Higher activity volume, stable running frequency, added cycling. Attempted interval running on 12th leading to strain, followed by active reduction in load, demonstrating flexible adjustment.
        *   Week 3 (15th-21st): Activity volume impacted by strain recovery and cold, frequency reduced, focused on low-intensity recovery and stretching.
        *   Week 4 (22nd-30th): Activity volume recovered and peaked, high running frequency, completed monthly closing run. Performance recovered to pre-injury level.
    *   **Training Cycle Peaks/Valleys**:
        *   **Peak Week**: Week 4, high activity frequency, significant weight management results, high mental energy.
        *   **Valley Week**: Week 3, lowest activity volume and intensity for the month due to combined strain and cold.
    *   **Performance Changes**: Running pace fluctuated due to weather (low temperature, wind) and physical state (strain, fatigue), but endurance consistently improved (single-session distance stabilized from 8km to attempting 9km). Ability to complete target running volume in low temperatures during Week 4 demonstrates enhanced stress resistance.
*   **3.2 Health Trends**
    *   **Sleep Trends**: Weekly sleep duration and quality directly impacted by **work schedule**. Week 1 night shifts caused sleep deprivation; Weeks 2-4 saw stable sleep duration and improved quality after returning to day shifts. Weekend catch-up sleep mechanism was effective.
    *   **Physical Health Trends**: Weight showed a "W-shaped" fluctuation: stable in Week 1 → slight rise post-night shift in Week 2 → peak in Week 3 due to social dinners → steady decline to monthly low in Week 4 after strict control. Trend shows strong monitoring and intervention capability regarding weight.
    *   **Mental Health Trends**: Stress levels strongly correlated with **work/study task density**. Positive mood correlated positively with **social feedback** (e.g., camping recognition, good news from friends, family support, excellent work rating) and **goal progress** (home purchase research, study progress).
    *   **Injury Impact**: Right calf strain on the 12th directly impacted Week 3 activity schedule, shifting to low-intensity recovery. Through rest, icing, and stretching, full recovery achieved by Week 4, without affecting core monthly running volume goal.
*   **3.3 Lifestyle Rhythm Trends**
    *   **Sleep Schedule & Mental State**: When bedtime was after 23:30 (e.g., 17th, 26th), the subjective feeling of effort during next-day morning runs increased. On days ensuring bedtime before 23:00, next-day work and study focus were higher.
    *   **Work/Life Rhythm Changes**: Emergency night shifts in Week 1 and concurrent new equipment training/home purchase planning in Weeks 3-4 were the two main periods of lifestyle tension. You balanced these through **strict time management** (e.g., using lunch break for loan calculations, fixed evening study time) and **proactive social relaxation** (camping, gatherings), resulting in an overall smooth transition.

**Module 4: Personalized Insights**
*   **Sleep ↔ Performance**: Data shows that when you maintain a regular day-shift sleep schedule (bedtime no later than 23:30), next-day morning run completion rate and subjective ease reach 100%. Conversely, after night shifts or late nights, even if running is completed, pace spontaneously slows by ~0'20"-0'30"/km, and physical startup is slower.
*   **Work Pressure ↔ Health**: Although no long business trips, **emergency night shifts** as a high-intensity work stress event led to three consecutive days of sleep deprivation, during which weight showed a slight increase (+0.3kg) and recovery run pace decreased. This indicates that acute work stress has a noticeable impact on short-term physical recovery and metabolism.
*   **Activity Type ↔ Physical State**: Comparison reveals that in weeks where you engaged in **at least one non-running cross-training session or outdoor hobby** (e.g., cycling, swimming, fishing), your mood score (inferred from description) was higher, and perceived risk of exercise injury was lower. Fishing, as a low-intensity outdoor activity, was particularly effective in alleviating work-related mental fatigue.
*   **Behavioral Habits ↔ Overall Health**: Data shows that **"combining high-intensity work periods with clear social/leisure plans"** is an effective pattern for you to maintain psychological balance. Examples: planning camping after night shifts (8th), arranging friend gatherings during training pressure periods (14th, 15th). This planned relaxation effectively counters stress and prevents burnout. Additionally, **"breaking down large goals into weekly executable small tasks"** (e.g., studying fixed chapters weekly, researching one home purchase area weekly) is key to your ability to maintain multi-threaded progress with a strong sense of achievement.

**Module 5: Anomaly Event Summary**
*   **Injury Event**:
    *   **Occurrence Time**: Afternoon of November 12th.
    *   **Injury Type**: Mild right calf muscle strain.
    *   **Impact Scope**: Led to suspension of running plans from 12th-14th, replaced with home rest and light stretching.
    *   **Recovery Status**: After 3 days of rest and subsequent gentle stretching, low-intensity activity resumed on the 15th, with no discomfort during morning run by the 18th, and full return to regular training after the 22nd. No secondary injury occurred during recovery.
*   **Activity Break Event**:
    *   **Break Period**: November 12th - November 14th.
    *   **Duration**: 3 days.
    *   **Cause**: Right calf strain due to insufficient warm-up for interval running training, leading to an active rest strategy.
    *   **Post-break Recovery Performance**: Gentle stretching on the 15th, cautious pace upon running resumption on the 16th, full return to normal training rhythm after the 18th. The break did not affect monthly exercise habits.
*   **Health Metric Fluctuation Event**:
    *   **Fluctuating Metric**: Weight.
    *   **Fluctuation Time**: November 19th - 20th.
    *   **Fluctuation Magnitude**: Increased from 71.1kg to 71.3kg, a gain of 0.2kg.
    *   **Cause**: Consecutive social dinners over two nights, leading to excessive calorie intake.
    *   **Subsequent Change**: Upon awareness, immediate diet control was implemented, combined with exercise from 21st-24th, resulting in steady weight decline to the monthly low of 70.0kg by the 30th.
*   **Lifestyle Rhythm Anomaly Event**:
    *   **Anomaly Period**: November 3rd - November 6th.
    *   **Anomaly Type**: Consecutive night shifts due to emergency production tasks, leading to circadian rhythm reversal.
    *   **Impact on Health/Activity**: Average daily sleep duration reduced to 5-6 hours with poor quality. Morning runs were still maintained, but pace decreased and subjective fatigue increased.
    *   **Recovery Measures & Effect**: After night shifts ended, utilized the weekend (7th-9th) for social/leisure activities (camping, dinners, karaoke) and catch-up sleep. By the 10th, sleep schedule and mental state had fully returned to the normal day-shift rhythm.
