Liu Zhiqiang currently resides in Kunshan, Suzhou, and commutes daily to Songjiang, Shanghai, for work. He, Yin Hao, and Wang Lei are in the same project team and often need to communicate about technical details. Outside of work, the three of them have a WeChat group where they frequently share interesting life updates and mobile gaming achievements. Due to Liu Zhiqiang’s cross-city commute, he has fewer in-person gatherings after work compared to Wang Lei. However, they still have at least one weekly online gaming session together and one or two weekend meals in Shanghai or Suzhou each month."

The two often played together in their hometown during childhood. Her cousin excelled in her studies, later attended university in Hangzhou, and stayed there to work as a UI designer. Although they live in different cities, the bond between the cousins remains strong, and their connection has never been interrupted. They primarily keep in touch through WeChat, sharing amusing anecdotes from daily life and work-related frustrations, occasionally teaming up to play \"Honor of Kings.\" Her cousin has an outgoing personality and sometimes offers Yin Hao advice on career development. During the National Day or Spring Festival holidays each year, if Yin Hao returns to Nantong, the two make time to meet for a meal; sometimes, when her cousin travels to Shanghai for business, she also arranges to have dinner with Yin Hao."
